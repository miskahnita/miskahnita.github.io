Causes and Effects of Innovation: Why do people innovate?
Innovation is a natural process that is necessary for businesses to succeed. It allows companies to come up with new ideas and products that can compete in the market. Innovation also benefits society as a whole by creating new technologies and innovations that make life easier for people.
