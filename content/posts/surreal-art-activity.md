Patents: What are the benefits and challenges of patents?
Patents are a form of intellectual property that allows an inventor to protect their ideas for products or services with a certain number of years after they come up with them. There are many benefits to patents, including helping to protect the inventor's intellectual property, increasing the chance that their idea will be developed into a successful product or service, and increasing the potential for royalties and other financial compensation that may be available to the inventor. There are also some challenges to patents, including ensuring that the invention is actually protected by a patent and that it is not copied or used without consent from the inventor.

Take flight!: Are there any other ways you can use your creativity to help solve problems?
Creativity can be used in a number of ways to solve problems. One way is to come up with big ideas. Big ideas are solutions that are large enough to be accomplished, but small enough that they can be implemented. There are many ways to come up with big ideas, so it is important to find the one that works best for you. Some ways to find big ideas include: 
1) thinking out loud – When you have a lot of ideas racing through your head, it can be helpful to take a break and talk about some of them with someone else. This will help you focus on what you want to achieve and avoid getting lost in your thoughts. 
2) brainstorming – This process helps you come up with multiple solutions at the same time and then put them all together to see which one might work best.
