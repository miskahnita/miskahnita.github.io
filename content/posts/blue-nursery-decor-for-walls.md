The process of innovation
Innovation is a process that can be divided into four distinct stages: ideation, development, implementation, and diffusion.
Ideation is the stage in which new ideas are generated. This can involve brainstorming sessions, market research, or simply observing the world around you. Once an idea has been generated, it must be developed. This stage includes testing the feasibility of the idea and refining it until it is ready to be implemented.

Implementation is when the innovative idea is put into practice. This stage can be challenging, as it requires bringing the idea to life and making it work within the context of your business or organisation. Diffusion is the final stage of innovation, and refers to how widely the new idea is adopted. This stage is often influenced by factors such as marketing and word-of-mouth.

The Idea: What is it? How can it be used?
Ideas are a great way to come up with new ideas. Some ideas are simple, while others may be more complex. However, they can all be used to improve the success of a project or to come up with new solutions to problems. Here are four examples of how ideas can be used in a project: 
1. A brainstorming session is a great way to get creative and come up with new ideas for a project.
2. If you have some specific goals for the project, you can use brainstorming sessions to help you achieve those goals.
3. Use ideas as part of your development process and see what comes out the most effective in terms of coming up with new solutions.
