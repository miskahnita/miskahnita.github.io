The evaluation of ideas
Evaluating ideas is important in order to determine which are worth pursuing and which are not. There are a few key factors to consider when evaluating an idea:
- How original is the idea? If it's been done before, is it being done in a new or different way?
- Is the idea feasible? Can it be realistically implemented?
- What is the potential impact of the idea? Will it make a difference?
- How much support does the idea have? Are there people who believe in it and will help to make it happen?

Why do we need to have big ideas?
There are a number of reasons why we need to have big ideas. 
1. Ideas can help solve problems. A big idea can be a solution to a problem that wasn't possible before. 
2. Idea generation can make us smarter. When we have ideas, we can learn from others and become better thinkers. 
3. Idea management is important for startups and businesses. Having a good idea is essential for any startup or business, as having too many ideas will lead to lower productivity and less success. 
4. Idea theft is a problem! Not everyone has the same idea for their business or product and someone else may have an idea that is better than your own and steal your idea without you realizing it. 
5. Idea culture is important for businesses!
