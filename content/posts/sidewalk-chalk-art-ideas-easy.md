Generating Ideas: Ways to come up with new ideas.
There are a number of ways to come up with new ideas. One way is to brainstorm with others. This can be done in a group setting or by yourself. Another way to generate new ideas is to do a mind map. This is where you take a blank piece of paper and draw a circle in the middle of it. Then, you start brainstorming around the central idea, branching off into different areas. You can also look for inspiration in other places, such as books, magazines, websites, etc. If youâ€™re stuck, try taking a walk or doing something completely unrelated to what youâ€™re working on to clear your mind and come back fresh.
