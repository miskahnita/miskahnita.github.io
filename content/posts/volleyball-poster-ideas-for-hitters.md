Developing ideas: how to take a good idea and make it great
If you have a good idea, but you're not sure how to make it great, don't worry. With a little creativity and hard work, you can turn your good idea into a great one.
Here are a few tips to get you started:

1. Do your research. Make sure you know everything there is to know about your idea before you start trying to improve it. This will give you a solid foundation to work from and help you avoid making any mistakes that could jeopardize the success of your project.
