Creative people are often thought of as those who have a great imagination and can come up with new ideas. However, creativity is not just about coming up with new ideas; creativity can also be used to create something that already exists. This is what many creative people do when they are trying to come up with a new design for their product or when they are creating a new idea for a project.

The power of creativity: What does it mean to be creative?
Creativity is a state of mind, it's ability to think outside the box and come up with new ideas. People who are creative often have an idea for something that they don't know how to do but they get stuck on how to make it a reality. One reason creativity is so important is because without creativity, there would be no innovation in the world. It can be difficult to be creative at times, but with practice you can become one of the most creative people around.

New ideas and how to find them: What factors do you need to consider?
Are you looking for new ideas to improve your business? If so, there are a few things you need to consider. Here are some factors to consider:
1) What is your target market? Are you targeting new customers or existing ones? 
2) What are your goals? Are you looking to grow or remain profitable? 
3) How can you reach your target market? Do you have a website or marketing strategy in place? 
4) How will your products and services meet the needs of your target market? Will you create a unique selling proposition or copy that stands out from the competition?
