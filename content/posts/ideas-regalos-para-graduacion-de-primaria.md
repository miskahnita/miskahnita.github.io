The difference between creativity and art: What are the essential differences?
Creativity, or the ability to think outside the box, is one of the most essential traits for a successful artist. Because creativity is so important, it can be hard to determine which category a person falls into when it comes to art.Some people may see creativity as simply coming up with new ideas or concepts; while others could see creativity as the ability to express oneself in a unique way. It all boils down to what someone considers essential to their artistry.
There are two main categories of creatives- those who come up with ideas and those who create something beautiful. While both types of creatives require some great talent and dedication, there are key differences that set creatives apart from other artists. 

The first difference between creative art and everyday art is that creative art often has a specific purpose or goal in mind.
