How can you come up with creative ideas?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one common goal: to make something new. Whether it’s coming up with a new product idea, coming up with a catchy headline or coming up with an innovative way to solve a problem, creativity is key. This can be hard to come by, but there are a few ways to get started. Here are five tips for coming up with creative ideas:
1. Take your time
Don’t rush your ideas. Take your time brainstorming and designing what you want your product or headline to say. This will help you focus on the right things and come up with ideas that are both interesting and well-conceived.

2. Be open to feedback
Before you finalize any of your ideas, take some feedback from friends, family or colleagues.
