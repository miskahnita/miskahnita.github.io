Commercialization: How can inventors develop their inventions into successful businesses?
There are a variety of ways to turn inventions into successful businesses, depending on the inventor and the business opportunity. 
One way is for an inventor to commercialize their invention. This can be done through a variety of ways, including selling the invention to a company, licensing the invention, or working with a business to help develop new products or services. 

Another way is for an inventor to work on their invention full time and then sell their product when it becomes available. This is an option if the inventor has a strong idea for a product or service that they believe could be successful. However, it can be difficult to make money from an invention this way. 
The third way is for an inventor to find someone who has an existing product or service that they could use as a model for their own product.

Brainstorming: What is brainstorming?
The purpose of brainstorming is to come up with new and innovative ideas. However, many people confuse brainstorming with brainstorming exercises. The two are completely different activities.
In a brainstorm, you don’t actually come up with new ideas; you just share your thoughts and ideas with others. It can be a great way to get feedback on what you’re working on and to get feedback on how others might view your idea.

When using brainstorming exercises, however, it’s important to keep the focus on coming up with new and innovative ideas. These exercises help you develop your thinking skills, but they aren’t substitutes for actual creative problem-solving.
