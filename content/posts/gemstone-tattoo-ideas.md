What are some of the most common invention ideas?
Inventions have helped humanity in many ways, from small gadgets to major advances in technology. Here are a few of the most common invention ideas:
1. Digital watches: In 1844, Swiss scientist Leonhard Euler invented the wristwatch, which allowed people to track their time and date more easily.
2. Air conditioning: In cooling off after a hot day, people would often open windows to air out their homes and families. In 1927, American engineer Charles Lindbergh patented an air conditioner that could be controlled by Pitot tubes to keep rooms cool on hot days.
3. Electric cars: Tesla Motors created the first electric car in 1938 and began production that year. By 1947, over half a million electric cars had been sold worldwide!

How to brainstorm effectively
When it comes to brainstorming, there are a few things you can do to make sure you're doing it effectively. First, it's important to have a clear goal in mind. What are you trying to achieve with this brainstorming session? Once you know what you're trying to accomplish, you can start generating ideas. It's helpful to write down every idea that comes to mind, no matter how crazy or far-fetched it may seem. You can always weed out the bad ideas later. The goal is just to get as many ideas as possible at this stage. Once you have a good list of ideas, start looking for patterns and connections between them. This will help you start narrowing down your options and come up with a plan of action. Brainstorming can be a great way to generate new ideas and solve problems, but only if you do it effectively.
