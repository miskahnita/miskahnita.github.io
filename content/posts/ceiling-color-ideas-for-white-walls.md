Conclusion: the importance of creative art in our lives
It is safe to say that creative art is important in our lives. After all, it is one of the few things that can truly make us feel alive. It can inspire us, move us, and even change us.
Think about the last time you were moved by a piece of art. Maybe it was a painting, a song, or even a film. Whatever it was, it likely had a profound effect on you. That’s because creative art has the power to touch our souls in a way that nothing else can.

It’s also important to remember that creative art is not just about entertainment. It can also be used as a powerful tool for self-expression and healing. For many people, art is a way to deal with difficult emotions and experiences. It can be a way to process trauma, express anger, and even find forgiveness.

Invention processes: What happens during the invention process?
Invention is the process that occurs during which a new idea or invention is created. This can be done through the creation of a new product, service, or idea. Inventions can also come about through the research and development of a new product. While both processes are essential to the success of an invention, they are also different. 
The invention process typically involves three steps: ideation, development, and commercialization. Ideation happens when an inventor has a great idea for a product or service and it doesn't yet have a name or prototype. Development happens when the inventor comes up with a working prototype of their product or service. Commercialization happens when someone decides to make their product or service available to the public. 

While all three steps are important, they each have their own importance.
