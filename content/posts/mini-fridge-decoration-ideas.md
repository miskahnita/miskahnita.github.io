That's what happens when you have a great idea. You start thinking about ways to make it a reality, and then the possibilities start opening up. There's no one answer to whether or not an idea is successful, but it's always worth trying out different approaches to see what works best for you.

Tips for Building a Better Home: How can you go about doing this?
One way to improve your home is by taking on some DIY projects. There are a variety of ways to go about this, so it really comes down to what you're interested in and what's available to you. Here are some tips for improving your home: 
2) Check out home improvement stores before starting any project. Not all stores carry the same tools and supplies, so you'll need to do some research before beginning any project. Look for stores that specialize in particular types of repairs or enhancements, like ad-hoc woodworking or electrical work. 
3) Get a good localpenter if you can't find the supplies or know someone who can help you out. A good localpenter will be able to help with everything from fixing dents in walls to installing new flooring or window trimming.
