Definition of a big idea: What are the consequences of considering something?
Big ideas are a common feature of any innovation, whether it’s in the business world or scientific research. They can be defined in many ways, but here are a few key points:
1. A big idea is an innovative solution to a problem that has yet to be solved.

2. It must have significant implications for the world as a whole, and its potential solutions must be fully realized before it can be considered a "big idea."

3. There is typically no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to developing a big idea, but some commonly used criteria include: novelty, impact/impactiveness, feasibility, and opportunity/opportunity cost.

How can we create innovation in our organizations?
There are many ways to create innovation in organizations. One way is to find outside sources of inspiration and learn from them. Another way is to come up with your own ideas and see how they can be implemented. Finally, it is important to constantly resist the urge to simply copy others and instead be creative and innovative yourself. These three methods can help a organization create innovation while maintaining its traditions and culture.
