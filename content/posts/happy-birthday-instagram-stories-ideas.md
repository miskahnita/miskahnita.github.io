Creative ideas: What are they?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes. They can be things as simple as a new way of looking at an old problem, or something much more ambitious. But whatever they are, they need to be on the mind of someone who is thinking about creativity and its role in their work. Here are some creative ideas to get your creative juices flowing: 
1) Create a new way of visualizing an old problem. One way to explore this would be to take a different view of a familiar problem. For example, you might think about how to visualize a situation where you have no idea what will happen next. This could lead to some interesting brainstorming sessions! 
2) Take on an unconventional challenge. Another way to get creative is by taking on an unconventional task that you know you can do but that others might not think of as being creative.

The environment: How will we handle the increasing amount of pollution?
In an effort to save the planet, many people are trying to devise new ways of living that do not rely on traditional methods of production. One such way is using green technology. 
One idea that has been gaining attention is the use of clean energy sources like solar and wind power. These sources provide clean energy that can be used to produce electricity without causing any pollution. 

It is important to note that these types of technologies are still in their development and will likely have a longer timeline before they are fully implemented on a large scale. However, if done correctly, these types of technologies could help us avoid some of the biggest pollutants on Earth.
