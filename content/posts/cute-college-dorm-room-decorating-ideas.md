New Directions: What options do these new ideas offer?
A new approach to mental health— called Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)—offers hope for a brighter future for those struggling with depression and other mental health conditions.
MBSR is a mindfulness-based stress reduction program that was created in the 1990s by Dr. Richard Davidson and Dr. Peter Salovey. It has since been used in clinical settings to help reduce stress and improve mental health, including reducing depression symptoms.

The program is based on the idea that when people are able to be present with their thoughts, feelings, and environment, they can better manage their own emotions and relationships. MBSR is also known for its ability to improve physical health by increasing overall well-being and decreasing stress levels.
