What are some types of innovation?
Innovation is the process of coming up with a new approach to an old problem. It can be in the form of a new product, service, or idea. Innovation can also come from changing how we do things or even changing how we think about things. There are many types of innovation, but some of the most common are: 
1) Technology: This refers to any new way of doing things that has the potential to improve people's lives. Examples include mobile phone technology, email, and online shopping. 
2) Social Media: This refers to any new way of spreading information or ideas around the internet. It can be used for marketing and advertising, or just to keep people up-to-date on current events.
