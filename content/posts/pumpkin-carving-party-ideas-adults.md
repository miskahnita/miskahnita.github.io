History of invention: How has innovation been used throughout history?
Invention has been a key part of human history for as long as humans have been able to create something.

Here are three examples of some of the most famous inventions in human history: 

1) The printing press was invented by Johannes Gutenberg in 1455, which allowed for the spread of literacy and knowledge across cultures.
