A brief history of the patent system: What is it?
The patent system, also known as the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) patent system, is a system of intellectual property rights that allows businesses to protect their discoveries and innovations by awarding exclusive rights to those who make them. The patent system was first instituted in 1790, when the US Congress passed the Patent Act. The patent system has been amended multiple times over the years, but its fundamental structure remains unchanged. The USPTO administers a number of different types of patents, including utility patents, design patents, industrial design patents, and trade secrets.

The challenges of innovation and its impact on business.
Innovation is one of the most important aspects of business. It allows firms to create new products and services that can be sold and generate new revenue. However, innovation can be challenging and has a strong impact on businesses. There are several challenges that companies face when trying to adopt innovative practices: 1) Lack of understanding of how innovation works – Many businesses are not sure what it takes to implement an innovation strategy and how it affects their business. 2) Implementation failures – When taking steps to adopt innovative practices, many firms end up implementing them incorrectly or without enough detail. This can lead to failed efforts, wasted resources and expensive lawsuits. 3) The negative effect of innovations – Some innovations have a significant positive impact on businesses such as increased efficiency or lowered costs. However, some innovations have a harmful impact, such as creating dependence on foreign manufacturers or exacerbating social disparities.
