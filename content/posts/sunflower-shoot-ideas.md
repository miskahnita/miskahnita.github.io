Definition of innovation: How does it differ from previous generations?
Innovation is the process of coming up with a new idea or product that is different from what has been done before. It can be classified into two main categories, incremental and revolutionary. Incremental innovation occurs in areas such as technology, business, and marketing; while revolutionary innovation occurs in areas such as science, medicine, and the environment. 
The definition of innovation has changing over time, but two main aspects have remained consistent: it should be creative, and it should be new to the market. Innovations should also be feasible to implement quickly and cost-effective. In order to achieve these goals, companies must have a clear understanding of how innovation works and how to define it narrowly or expansively according to their needs.

Types of creativity:
Creativity is a broad term that can refer to any activity or feeling that leads to unique and original ideas. There are many different types of creativity, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. Here are three examples: visual creativity, auditory creativity, and kinesthetic creativity.
Visual creativity is often measured by how much creative ideas the individual can come up with in a short amount of time. This type of creativity is often associated with art, fashion, and design. Visual artists may use various mediums such as paintings, sculptures, graphics, photography, and 3D printing to create their output.

Auditory creativity is often measured by how well the individual can generate new sounds. This type of creativity often occurs when someone listens to music or takes part in creative activities that produce new sounds.

The future of technology is constantly in flux, and so is the way we view it.
In the coming years, technology will continue to change and evolve at an alarming rate. Some of the most exciting new ideas that come up in these times are artificial intelligence (AI), big data, blockchain technology, and 3D printing. With these technologies becoming more popular every day, it's important to keep up with the latest trends and developments in order to be ahead of the curve. Here are some examples of how AI is already changing the way we view the world: 
It has long been speculated that AI could soon become self-aware and even sentient. In a recent study published in "Nature", researchers have created a computer program that can learn from itself and develop its own strategy. This is a huge achievement because until now, it has been difficult for computers to learn from their own mistakes.
