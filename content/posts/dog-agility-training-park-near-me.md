Research/Inspiration: What have other bloggers or businesses done that you’re inspired by?
Creative ideas come from all around us, and some are more obvious than others. Sometimes all you need is inspiration, and other times it can take a little more effort to find it. Here are a few examples of creative ideas that have inspired me in the past: 
1. Creating a blog – This one’s easy enough, right? Just start writing and share your thoughts with the world. What do other bloggers or businesses do that you’re inspired by? You might be surprised at how much they have in common! 

2. starting a business – This is another easy one! If you have the passion and the drive, there’s no reason not to start your own business. It can be a lot of hard work, but it can also be really rewarding if you hit your goals.
