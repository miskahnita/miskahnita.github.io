What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from new ways to cook, Tate Modern’s newest art gallery or a new way of travelling. Here are some of our favourites:
1. A creative way to relax: take a walk in nature. This can involve finding a meadow with plenty of trees, sitting under a tree and taking in the natural sounds.

2. Experiment with different food preferences: try out different recipes or eat something that you’ve never tried before. This will open your eyes to what foods you like and how they taste.

3. Get creative with your time: use up time by doing something creative like painting, drawing or sculpting. This will help you de-stress and get lost in thought for a little bit.

What are the benefits of having ideas?
Ideas can be a powerful tool for problem solving. They can also help you create new ideas and drive new thoughts. The following are some of the benefits of having ideas: 
1. You get more done. When you have many ideas, your mind is more open and able to think of potential solutions. 
2. You learn more quickly. When you have a lot of ideas, you can learn from them and make better decisions faster than if you only had a few choices to make. 
3. You are more creative. Ideas are what allow us to come up with new solutions to problems and come up with novel ways to do things that we never thought of before. 
4. You save time and money.
