Ideas for Home Improvements: From changing lightbulbs to installing awnings, there are many options.
Diy Home Improvements: From changing lightbulbs to installing awnings, there are many options to improve your home. Here are some ideas for you to get started: 
1. Change your light bulbs: A simple change can make all the difference in how your home looks and feels. Use a switch or transformer to turn CFLs into LEDs, or use an old incandescent bulb to get a new, more energy-efficient investment. 

2. Add insulation: When it comes to heating and cooling systems, insulation is essential. Put up some thermal insulation foam if you need extra warmth or protection from the elements outside. Or install a window air conditioner with insulation so the cold air doesn‚Äôt enter your home as easily as the hot air.

How to Make Your Home More Functional
Last year, I was faced with a unique challenge. My home was slowly being used less and less as my office became more and more. To keep up with the trend, I decided to create a few key functional pieces in my home that could help me get more done. Here are some tips on how to make your home more functional: 
1. Make an organized space - One of the most important things you can do to improve your productivity is make sure you have an organized space in which to work. This can be anything from a shelves of books on one side of the room to wires leading out of the windows for potential cable management purposes. 

2. Get rid of distractions - When it comes to working, it‚Äôs important to keep things as quiet and distraction-free as possible.
