The power of a big idea: can change the way we think and see the world
Big ideas have the power to change the way we think and see the world. They can challenge our assumptions and help us to see things in new ways.


For example, the big idea of evolution has helped us to understand the diversity of life on Earth and our place in the natural world. The big idea of gravity has helped us to understand how the universe works. And the big idea of relativity has helped us to understand the nature of time and space.



Big ideas can also change the way we see ourselves and our place in the world. The big idea of human rights, for example, has helped us to understand that all people are equal and deserving of respect. The big idea of democracy has helped us to understand that everyone should have a say in how they are governed.



So what is your big idea?

The role of invention in innovation: What benefits can it bring to businesses?
Invention is a process of coming up with a new design, product or service that is different from those currently in use. It can have a number of benefits for businesses, including increasing efficiency and saving time. For example, the discovery of a new vaccine could lead to saved lives and reduced TB cases. There are also plenty of other examples where innovation can have significant impacts on businesses. For example, the development of new transportation methods could lead to increased efficiency in travel or the development of new materials that can improve quality control processes.

Definition of Invention: inventions are the results of creative thinking.
Invention is the result of creative thinking. This thinking can be done in a number of ways, but the most common way to come up with new ideas is through brainstorming. brainstorming is an informal process where people share their ideas with one another, without any specific goal in mind. By doing this, you can come up with a number of new ideas that could potentially be used in a product or service.
What makes brainstorming so helpful is that it allows for creativity to freely flow. When people areallowed to go at their own pace and have unrestricted access to their thoughts, they are more likely to come up with new and innovative solutions. This quality helps inventions become more effective and innovation becomes more commonplace.
