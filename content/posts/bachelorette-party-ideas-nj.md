It is a form of mental gymnastics that uses brain waves to improve problem-solving skills. The theory behind brainstroming is that by focusing on certain patterns and ideas, we can improve our thinking skills and increase our creativity.
There are already several companies that use brainstroming in their businesses. One company, called Cortex, sells an app called Brainstorm that helps you focus on specific problems and ideas to improve your problem solving skills. Other companies that are using brainstroming include Google, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft. There is no single answer to how or when brainstroming should be used in business, but there are some key principles to follow if you want to try it out for yourself.

What is brainstroming?
Brainstroming is a term used to describe the phenomenon of sudden, unexpected changes in thinking or behavior. It can be a result of a single event, such as seeing a new person or experiencing an unusual situation, or it can be more general and persistent.
