The difference between creativity and art: What are the essential differences?
Creativity, or the ability to think outside the box, is one of the most essential traits for a successful artist. Because creativity is so important, it can be hard to determine which category a person falls into when it comes to art.Some people may see creativity as simply coming up with new ideas or concepts; while others could see creativity as the ability to express oneself in a unique way. It all boils down to what someone considers essential to their artistry.
There are two main categories of creatives- those who come up with ideas and those who create something beautiful. While both types of creatives require some great talent and dedication, there are key differences that set creatives apart from other artists. 

The first difference between creative art and everyday art is that creative art often has a specific purpose or goal in mind.

brainstorming: What are some creative ways to come up with creative ideas?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but there are some basic types that you can use to come up with your own. Here are some creative ideas to get you started:
1. Brainstorm with others: Sometimes the best way to come up with new ideas is to brainstorm with other people. This can help you get feedback on what might work and what might not, and it can also help you brainstorm ways to make your ideas even better.
