How creativity can help us: Creativity can help us come up with new ideas, solutions, or plans.
Creativity has been said to be one of the most important skills a person can have. It can help us come up with new ideas, solutions, or plans. While creativity is often seen as a positive attribute, not everyone is naturally creative. However, there are ways to improve creativity and become more inventive. Here are eight tips for becoming more creative: 
1. Be open to new ideas. The more open you are to new ideas, the more likely you are to come up with them. If you're resistant to change or don't like trying new things, it will be difficult for you to be creative.

2. Give yourself time and space to think creatively. When you're stuck on a problem or have an idea for something new, give yourself some time away from distractions so that your brain can work freely.
