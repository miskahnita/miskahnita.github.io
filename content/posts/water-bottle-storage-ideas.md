The drawbacks of brainstorming
In a work environment, brainstorming is often thought of as a go-to method for generating new ideas. However, there are several drawbacks to this technique that can make it less effective than other methods.
One drawback is that brainstorming can lead to groupthink. This phenomenon occurs when people in a group tend to conform to the same thinking pattern in order to avoid conflict. This can stifle creativity and prevent different perspectives from being heard.

Another issue with brainstorming is that it can be difficult to generate ideas when everyone is focused on the same task. When people are talking over each other and trying to come up with ideas at the same time, it can be difficult to have an organized and productive discussion.

Finally, brainstorming sessions can often be dominated by a few extroverted individuals.
