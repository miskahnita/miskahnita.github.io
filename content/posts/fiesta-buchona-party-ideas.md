Section 1: Defining "Diy".
Diy, or "Do It Yourself" is a popular term that refers to the process of completing a task without the help of an outside professional. Diy projects can range from simple tasks like painting a room to more complex endeavors like building a deck. No matter what the project is, there are several key things to keep in mind when embarking on a Diy journey.
The first thing to consider is whether or not you have the time and patience to complete the project. Diy projects often take longer than expected and can be frustrating if you're not prepared for setbacks. It's important to set realistic expectations and give yourself plenty of time to finish the project.

Another thing to keep in mind is your skill level. Not all Diy projects are created equal. Some require more skills and knowledge than others.

The power of big ideas
Big ideas are what drive innovation, creativity and success. They are the seeds of new thoughts and ideas that can change the course of a company or individual. Here, we explore four powerful ways to get big ideas in your head:
1. Get inspired by others: Take a look around you and see how others are able to come up with amazing solutions or new ideas. What do they do that you can't? Why did they do it that way and what were their results?

2. Adopt a principle: There's no need to be unique if you have a principle at the heart of your idea. Look for someone who has already done something great on this topic and copy their approach/methodology/mesurement/whatever it is.
