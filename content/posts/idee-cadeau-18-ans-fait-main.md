Definition of innovation:
Innovation is the process of creating new products, services or businesses. It can be defined in many ways, but one common definition is when a new idea or product is different from what has been done before and is potential savior for a company or industry. Innovation can also refer to ideas for change in how things are done or something that makes a business more efficient or profitable.

The five types of ideas: creative,icidal, practical, educational, and entertaining.
Creative ideas can be anything from cleaning up your basement to starting a business. They can be fun and enjoyable, or they can have a serious purpose. Educational ideas are important, especially for younger generations who are just starting out in life. They can help teach them about different topics and how to get things done. Practical ideas are great for people who need to do things quickly or who don't have time to waste. Some examples of practical ideas include becoming a doctor, lawyer, or mechanic. The last type of idea is the most interesting and entertaining, because it can bring people together in a shared interest. For example, if you're an artist, you might want to start a painting blog or create a YouTube channel about your work.
