Creative process: How do artists come up with their ideas?
The Creative Art process begins with the artistâ€™s idea. This idea can be something as simple as a thought or a plan, but it is important that the artist is able to come up with an interesting and unique solution to the problem at hand. After coming up with an interesting solution, the artist continues working on this solution until they have a workflow that they are happy with. The artwork then becomes a product of this unique workflow.

The Different Types of Brainstroming:
As we all know, brainstroming is a term used to describe the phenomenon of sudden, unexpected thoughts or ideas. Brainstroming can be negative or helpful, and it can be associated with brainstorming sessions or creative thinking. There are three main types of brainstroming: cognitive, emotional, and interpersonal. 
Cognitivebrainstroming is when someone has a suddenZ wave-like experience in their mind that includes new and innovative thought. These thoughts may be related to something that the person has been working on for months or years but never considered before. Emotionalbrainstroming is when someone experiences intense emotions such as joy, sadness, worry, or anger. It can be overwhelming to try and contain these feelings and they will often take over the person's mind completely.
