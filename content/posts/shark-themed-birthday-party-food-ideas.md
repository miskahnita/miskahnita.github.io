Origin of invention: Why was a particular invention chosen for development?
Inventions are often chosen for development based on a number of factors, including need, potential market, and other costs. There is an Origin of Invention story to be told every time a new invention is created. The story begins with the idea and then the process that went into making it a reality. 
Some inventions are born out of necessity; others come from pure thought. Sometimes, an idea just pops into someone's head and they start to see how it could be used in the real world. Other times, a team of experts put their thoughts together and come up with a great solution or innovation. 

The Origin of Invention story isn't always about bricks and mortar. Sometimes, ideas just take off in different directions after being studied and tested in various settings.

Overcoming Obstacles to Innovation
Innovation is critical to the success of any business, yet it can be difficult to achieve. There are a number of obstacles that can stand in the way of innovation, including a lack of resources, a fear of change, and a lack of creativity. However, there are ways to overcome these obstacles and create an environment that is conducive to innovation.
By identifying the obstacles that are standing in the way of innovation, businesses can take steps to remove them. One of the most common obstacles is a lack of resources. This can be addressed by allocating more funding to research and development or by partnering with other companies that have the resources needed.
