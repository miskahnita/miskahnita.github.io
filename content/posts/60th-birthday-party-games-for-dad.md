What is innovation?
Innovation is a process of creating new products or services that are better than the ones that are currently available. Innovation can be seen as the continuous evolution of ideas and concepts, whether those ideas come from scientists, engineers, businessmen, or anyone else who has an idea for a new product or service. Innovation is also the result of using new technologies and methods to improve upon older ones.
The term "innovation" can be used in different ways depending on who is talking about it. One meaning would be taking something old and making it better, while another could refer to putting something new into use to improve performance. Whatever the definition, innovation is important and always in search of improvement.

What’s in store for the future of technology?
This year, many articles and presentations were made about the future of technology. The topics ranged from the digital age to artificial intelligence and beyond. However, one thing that was conspicuously absent was any discussion on how technology could impact our social lives. 
It seems that many people are still quite unsure of how technology will have an impact on our daily lives. Some believe that it will only be a force for good, while others remain worried about its ability to divide us further along lines of gender, race, and economic status. Some may even see it as a harbinger of great evil - like in the case of AI becoming self-aware and exploiting humans for their own gain. But whatever the future holds, one thing is for sure: tech will have an important role to play.

Overcoming creative blocks
There are many ways to overcome creative blocks. Some people find that taking a break from their work and doing something completely different helps them to refresh their ideas. Others find that talking to someone else about their project can give them new perspectives.
Some people find it helpful to set strict limits on their work in order to force themselves to be more creative. For example, they may give themselves an hour to come up with an idea for a new painting or only allow themselves to use three colors in their next piece of pottery.

 Whatever method you use, it is important to remember that there is no one right way to overcome creative blocks. What works for one person may not work for another. The most important thing is to keep trying new things until you find what works for you.
