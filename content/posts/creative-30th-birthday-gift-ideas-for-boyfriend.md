Mental training: What is it, how can we do it, and why should we bother?
Mental training is the process of increasing a person's ability to think, focus, and decision-making. There are many reasons to care about mental training, including improving your work performance, increasing your overall well-being, and preventing depression and anxiety. Here are five big ideas about how mental training can benefit you:
1. Improve Your Work Performance: Mental training can help you better focus on tasks at hand and achieve success in your workplace. In a study published in the journal "Personality Psychology," researchers found that people who had learned to think faster were more productive than those who did not. The faster you learn to think, the better prepared you will be for any task that comes your way.

2. Increase Your Overall Well-Being: Mental training has been shown to improve mood and reduce stress levels.

Prototype and Evaluation: How does one go about creating a prototype of an invention?
Prototype is a term that is often used in the industry to describe a preliminary version of an invention. It can also be used more generally to describe any form of product or service development. Prototype development typically begins with the identification of an idea or problem that needs to be solved before starting on the full development process. Once the problem has been identified, it is possible to explore potential solutions and prototypes can be created based on these solutions. After prototypes have been created, it is important to evaluate them for their feasibility and how they might be improved.
