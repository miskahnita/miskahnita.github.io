Commercializing an invention: What is the commercialization process?
Commercialization is the process of bringing an invention to market and making it available to the general public. There are a number of different commercialization processes that can be used to bring an invention to market. The most common process is license-back, in which the inventor and licensee agree on a royalty schedule and terms of use. License-back usually occurs when an invention is filed with the USPTO. License-backs are also common when a patent application is filed with the USPTO. Other commercialization processes include industriallicense, which involves selling rights to use an invention in a specific industry; technologylicense, which allows manufacturers or other businesses to use an invention in order to create products or services; and netpatent, which allows inventors to make money by selling patents they receive from others.

The Power of Ideas: Why having a good idea is important.
There's no doubt that having a good idea is important. Ideas are the lifeblood of any business or organisation - without them, you simply wouldn't have anything to offer customers or clients. But what makes a good idea? And how can you make sure that your ideas are as strong as they can be?
A good idea needs to be original and relevant to your target audience. It should also be something that you're passionate about, as this will help you to sell it and get others on board with it. Finally, it's worth considering whether your idea is feasible and practical - if it's not, then it might not be worth pursuing.

If you've got a great idea, then don't be afraid to share it with others.
