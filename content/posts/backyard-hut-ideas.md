The Psychology of Idea Generation
When it comes to big ideas, there are a few things that all people have in common. They all want to create something new and exciting, and they all feel like they can do it. This is where creativity comes into play. People are able to come up with ideas on their own, but often they need help coming up with the best ones. Here are four ways to get creative juices flowing:
1. Take on a smaller project: Sometimes the best way to get started with an idea is by taking on a smaller project that you can complete quickly and easily. This will help you get your head around the concept and start thinking about ways that you could improve it.

2. Draw on your experience: When you have some experience under your belt, it becomes easier to come up with powerful ideas.

What are big ideas?
Big ideas are important, but they can be hard to come by. Here are some tips on finding big ideas that will help you succeed: 
1. Define what you want your business to achieve. Once you have a clear idea of what your business wants to accomplish, it's easier to come up with ideas for how to achieve it. 
2. Think about who your target market is. Big businesses often think about their target market as all the people who are potential customers or employees who might be interested in their product or service. However, there are also many people out there who don't have a specific interest in your product or service, and you need to include them in your thinking while developing your big idea. 
3. Create a vision and mission statement.
