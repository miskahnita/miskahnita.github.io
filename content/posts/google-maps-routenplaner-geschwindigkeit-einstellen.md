The four main areas of innovation: technology, design, management, and market.
Innovation technology is the process of creating new products, services, or ideas that are more efficient, effective, and affordable than those currently in use. Innovation design is the process of designing a system that meets specific needs and objectives while also remaining safe and secure. Management is the ability to ensure that innovation technology spreads throughout a company so it can be used by employees, customers, or partners. And finally, the market is the factors that decide whether innovation will be successful and become mainstream.
