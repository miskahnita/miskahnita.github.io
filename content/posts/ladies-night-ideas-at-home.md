How do you choose the right idea to pursue?
There are a lot of choices to make when it comes to what ideas to pursue. It can be hard to know which one is the right one, especially if you don’t have any experience or knowledge about the topic. Here are some tips to help you choose the right idea: 
1. Start with something you’re passionate about: This is always a good option, because it will give you more energy and motivation to keep going. If you don’t have anything else in life that you want to work on, then pursuing an idea that interests you might be a better decision than anything else. 
2. Do your research: This is another important factor to consider when choosing an idea. Make sure you do your research before making any decisions, so that you understand what kind of risks and rewards there could be involved.
