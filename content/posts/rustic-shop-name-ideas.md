Contemporary Inventions: The computer, the internet, 3D printing
Invention is the key to progress. It is what takes us from the horse and buggy to the automobile, from telegraphs to telephones, from mainframe computers to laptops. And it is what has given us 3D printing, a technology that has the potential to change manufacturing as we know it.
3D printing is an additive manufacturing process, which means that it builds objects by adding layers of material one at a time. This is in contrast to subtractive manufacturing processes like CNC machining, which involve cutting away material to create an object.

3D printing has been around for decades, but it has only recently become accessible to consumers and small businesses. Thanks to advances in 3D printer technology and the availability of affordable 3D printers, this transformative technology is now within reach of anyone with an idea and a bit of creativity.

Types of innovation: What are some types of innovations that businesses commonly use?
Innovation is a process of change that leads to the creation of new products, services, or economy. There are many different types of innovation, but four common types are product innovation, service innovation, market innovation, and business model innovation. 
Product Innovation: Product innovations are changes in the physical form of something that makes it more accessible or useful to consumers. For example, Google created Street View in order to allow people to see how their cities look from close up. This type of innovation is often used for education and marketing purposes. Service Innovation: Service innovations are changes in the way services are delivered to customers. For example, Apple Watch was developed as a way for people to keep track of their time and step-by-step exercises without having to carry a phone around. This type of innovation is often used for health and fitness applications.
