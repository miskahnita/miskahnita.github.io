New models for innovation: How can new models for innovation be introduced into current practices to improve outcomes?
Innovation is an ever-evolving process that can improve outcomes by introducing new models and concepts into current practices. Several recent studies have shown that innovation can lead to increased success in terms of productivity, profitability, and customer satisfaction. However, there are some challenges that need to be overcome before innovation can be successful. One challenge is the fear of change, which can impede the development of new models and concepts. Another challenge is the lack of evidence that a model will work in practice, which can limit the impact of innovation. Finally, there is the need for regulatory support in order to ensure that innovations are brought to market successfully.

The history of brainstorming
In the late 1940s, a group of psychologists working at Yale University began to study what is now known as brainstorming. The team, led by George Prince, was interested in finding out whether people could come up with more ideas if they worked on their own or in groups.
The psychologists conducted a series of experiments in which participants were asked to come up with as many ideas as possible for different topics. They found that people who worked on their own came up with fewer ideas than those who worked in groups.

The psychologists also found that the quality of the ideas generated was better when people worked in groups. This is because people are able to build on each other's ideas and come up with new and better ideas as a result.

The findings of the Yale study sparked a lot of interest in the idea of brainstorming and its potential benefits.
