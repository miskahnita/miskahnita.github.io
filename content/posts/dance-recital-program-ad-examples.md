Nature has always been a source of inspiration for new inventions. People have come up with new ways to do things based on natural phenomena for centuries. Some of the most famous examples include the wheel, the pyramids, and the light bulb. Today, we continue to see people come up with new ideas based on nature because technology has advanced so much since then. There are countless ways that technology can be used to improve our lives, and one of the most common ways it is used is through invention. Invention ideas are often based on something that already exists in nature and can be used in a more efficient way or with less effort than what people have currently thought of.
