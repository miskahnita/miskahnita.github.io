Invention is the use of new ideas or devices to improve or complete a task. The history of invention is filled with stories of people who came up with new ways to do things, and often these ideas led to new products, services, or treatments. Today, we continue to see innovation in all areas of life, from technology to fashion. In some cases, this has led to profound change for the world around us - for example, the development of the printing press and the telephone.

The rules of brainstorming.
1. Brainstorming is a process that can be used to generate ideas and solve problems.
2. There are some rules that should be followed when brainstorming, in order to make it more effective.

3. The first rule is to suspend judgment while ideas are being generated. This means that no idea should be immediately rejected, no matter how crazy it may seem at first.

4. The second rule is to allow for freewheeling association. This means that ideas should be generated without any restrictions, and any connections between ideas should be explored.

5. The third rule is to build on the ideas of others. This means that once an idea has been suggested, others should try to build on it and expand upon it.

6. The fourth rule is to record all of the ideas that are generated during the brainstorming session.

Projects: How do you go about creating your DIY project?
There are many ways to create a DIY project, but the most common way is by finding a family member or friend to help. This can be done by asking them for help with a task they are familiar with, or by asking if they have any tools or supplies that you could borrow. There are many resources available online and in stores, so it is important to research what you need before beginning a project. Once you have an idea of what you want to create, it is important to find creative ideas. Some commonDIY projects include painting ceilings, fixing glass windows, and making furniture.

Review: What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from coming up with a new recipe to designing a new piece of clothing. However, some creative ideas are better than others. Here are five creative ideas to get you started: 
1. Start with the basics: Start by brainstorming what your idea could be. What are some things you can think of that could be used in your idea? Examples might include an ornament, a piece of art, or even a little project for your room. 
2. Think outside the box: Once you have an idea for something, start thinking about ways to make it work. What is something that has never been done before? How can you make it unique and interesting? 
3. Be daring: Don’t just take what someone has already done and create something new; go beyond what people usually think of when they think of creativity.

What is the best way to approach new ideas?
New ideas are always something to be taken with a grain of salt, but there are a few things that can help make them more palatable. One approach is to ask yourself what the potential benefits of the idea are. If you can find an example of how the idea could be used in your field or business, it can help make it more palatable. Another thing to keep in mind is that new ideas should not be taken lightly - if they seem too good to be true, they probably are. However, by taking a step back and investigating the potential benefits, you can form a better opinion of whether or not this is something that would work for you.
