What is innovation?
Innovation is the process of creating new products, services or ideas that differ from those currently in use. Innovation can be seen as a way to improve the quality of life for users, as well as innovation can help companies grow and succeed. There are many different types of innovation, but some common ones include:
1. New technology: This includes any new method or invention that improves on what has been used before. For example, a recent innovation is using drones to deliver food items to customers. This type of innovation has the potential to change how we consume and provide better service at a much lower cost than traditional methods.

2. Beating the competition: This refers to improving upon an existing product or service in order to bring about a competitive advantage over your opponents. For example, Apple Inc.

The future of finance: What will new financial technologies mean for society?
There are a number of new financial technologies that could have a dramatic impact on society in the next few years. Here are four examples:
1. Blockchains: Blockchain technology is a distributed database that allows for secure, transparent and tamper-proof transactions. This could mean big changes for the way money is used, especially in the banking and insurance sectors.

2. Artificial intelligence (AI): AI has already been used to identify and predict stock prices, make financial decisions and even provide human advisors to businesses. It's only going to get more advanced and sophisticated in the future, and with the right applications – such as peer-to-peer marketplaces or taxes – it could also have a huge impact on social issues such as joblessness and poverty.
