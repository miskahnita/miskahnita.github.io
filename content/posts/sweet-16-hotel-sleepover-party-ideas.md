The future of work: What will new technologies mean for the workforce?
New technologies will have a significant impact on the workforce in the not too distant future. They include things like artificial intelligence (AI), nanotechnology, and robotics. All of these new technologies present opportunities and challenges for the workforce. 
One important thing to note is that no one technology will be completely dominant. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages. 

For example, AI can help improve efficiency in many industries, such as retail or factory work. However, it can also lead to unemployment if used incorrectly. 

Nanotechnology offers a number of potential solutions for improving efficiency in businesses and workplaces. However, it is still in its early stages of development and has some potential drawbacks as well. For example, nanotechnology-based clothing can't be recycled so it needs to be disposed of properly or stored away for long periods of time.

Social media: How will social media impact the future of business?
The future of business depends on how social media affects the way businesses operate. This is evident in the way that online communities, such as Facebook and Twitter, have created an individualized society where people are more interconnected than ever before. With this connectivity comes a need for companies to manage their social media accounts in order to remain relevant and popular. Additionally, businesses must be mindful of the ways in which social media can be used to infringe on privacy rights and mislead customers.
