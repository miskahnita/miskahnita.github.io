How can brainstroming be used in your business?
Do you want to know how you can use brainstroming in your business? If yes, read on. Brainstroming is a powerful tool that can help you understand your customer and find new areas of growth for your business. Here are a few tips to get started:
1. Legitimate brainstroming should start with understanding what your customers want and need. This information should be gathered through customer surveys, interviews, and focus groups. Once you have this information, you can begin exploring different areas of customer needs and desires.

2. Use brainstroming to reach out to customers who have not interacted with you before. Reach out to customers who may be interested in what you have to offer but haven’t had the opportunity to speak with you yet. This will help increase brand awareness and build trust between yourself and your customers.

What makes a big idea: originality, simplicity, and the ability to provoke change
When it comes to big ideas, there are three key elements that make them truly great: originality, simplicity, and the ability to provoke change. Without these essential ingredients, an idea is simply not going to have the impact or staying power that it needs to be truly successful.
 Originality is key because it allows an idea to stand out from everything else that’s already out there. If an idea is too similar to something else, it’s not going to make much of a splash. But if it’s completely new and different, people will take notice and want to learn more about it.

Simplicity is also important because it makes an idea easy to understand and remember. If an idea is too complex, people will quickly lose interest and move on to something else.
