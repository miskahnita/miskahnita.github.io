Invention history: How did some inventions become successful?
Invention history is a long and flexible way to describe the process of creating something new. From the early days of mankind, when people were just starting to learn how to make things, Invention has always been an important part of human life. Sometimes, an idea can be very simple, and other times it may be more complex. But in both cases, it can bring about a lot of change and improvement for those who come up with it. Here are some examples of inventions that have made a big difference in the world:
1. The Telephone: This invention was actually two separate ideas – one by Alexander Graham Bell and the other by Samuel Morse. Both men were working on different projects at the time, but they came up with a working prototype together. In 1876, they announced their findings to the public and quickly became famous for their work.

The 4 Types of Ideas: Objectives: What is the end goal? Creative: How do you come up with the idea? Imaginary: What could be possible? Fantastical: Is this really happening or is it a dream? Practical: How would this work in reality? futuristic: What if this happened in the future?
Ideas are a necessary part of any business or project. They can be used to come up with solutions to problems or to create new ideas. However, they can also be used for evil purposes. Some people use ideas as tools to manipulate others, while others use them as vehicles for their own creativity. 
The different types of objectives you might come up with in order to create an idea are imaginary, fantastic, and possible. Imaginary objectives are where you forget the end goal or what the final outcome will be. Fantastical objectives are where you think about things that couldn’t actually happen but could still make senses if done in a certain way.

The challenge of innovation: What are the challenges associated with innovative thinking?
Invention ideas are at the heart of most businesses and economies. They can provide new products or services that improve how people live, work, and play. But innovation can be a challenge, as it often requires fresh thinking and new ways of looking at old ideas. Here are some challenges associated with innovative thinking:
1) Finding the right balance – trying too hard to be different can backfire, leading to stagnation or even failure.

2) Facing the unknown – trying to invent something that has never been done before can be risky and time-consuming.

3) Working with others – collaborating with other teams and individuals can help speed up the process and create a more cohesive group.

4) Creating value – creating new products or services that offer value for customers is one of the most difficult aspects of innovation.
