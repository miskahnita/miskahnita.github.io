History of innovation:
Innovation has been a part of human history for as long as humans have been able to think about it. From the early civilizations that developed methods of making things that didn't exist before, to the modern day innovators who are constantly creating new ways to improve life and make it more efficient, innovation is something that has always been a part of our lives. And yet, there was once a time where innovation was practically nonexistent in most cultures. This was the era known as the Dark Ages.
The Dark Ages were an era in human history when creativity was almost non-existent and innovation was virtually absent. While some aspects of this time period did experience some form of innovation, such as new methods of farming or weapons, most aspects of society were either unaltered or slowly improving upon what existed before.

What is invention?
Invention, sometimes called the discovery of a valuable new technology or process, is a moment when an idea or design comes to someone and they decide to put it into use. Invention can be something as simple as a new way of making a product, or something more complex like creating a new method for extracting oil from coal. It can come from anyone â€“ even people who have nothing to lose. Inventors are often able to see their ideas through to the end, and often find new ways to make their products or processes even more effective. For example, inventors who create air-conditioning technology may not have thought about how it would be used in hot climates, but they came up with a better way to cool buildings and this has led to new applications for the technology all over the world.
