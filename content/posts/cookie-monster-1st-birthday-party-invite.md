How innovation benefits society:
Innovation benefits society by increasing productivity, innovation reducing costs, and improving the quality of products. Productivity is the amount of work done per hour. Reducing costs is the lowering of prices or the reduction in cost of producing a good or service. Improving quality is the improvement of something that does not meet all expectations, for example a product that is not as effective as it should be. Innovation can be thought of as any change in how something is done, from making a new product to changing how services are provided.

Creative art is often characterized by its unique and expressive elements. It can be considered to be an individual form of expression, or a way to express oneself.

Tips for Building a Better Home: How can you go about doing this?
One way to improve your home is by taking on some DIY projects. There are a variety of ways to go about this, so it really comes down to what you're interested in and what's available to you. Here are some tips for improving your home: 
2) Check out home improvement stores before starting any project. Not all stores carry the same tools and supplies, so you'll need to do some research before beginning any project. Look for stores that specialize in particular types of repairs or enhancements, like ad-hoc woodworking or electrical work. 
3) Get a good localpenter if you can't find the supplies or know someone who can help you out. A good localpenter will be able to help with everything from fixing dents in walls to installing new flooring or window trimming.
