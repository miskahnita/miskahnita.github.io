What are the new ideas?
It is no secret that the world is changing, and that this change is happening in many different ways. Some of the most recent changes include the rise of technology, which has led to a new level of accessibility for people with disabilities. Other changes include the shifting sands of geopolitics, which have led to a more complex world order. And yet still others can be seen in shifts in social norms and behaviors, as people become more open to different ideas and lifestyles.
One important concept that has been growing in prominence over the past few years is inclusion. This concept has been barrinated by a number of events, from #MeToo to the Parkland shooting, that have raised awareness and asked society how it can embrace diversity while protecting safety and civil rights. Inclusion means understanding and accepting different perspectives, cultures, and religions while also considering each person’s unique needs.

The Future of Work: What needs to be done to keep people employed?
There is no doubt that the future of work is fraught with uncertainty. There are many reasons for this, but one big factor is the increasing use of technology. The way that technology affects work and jobs is changing constantly, so it's important to keep up with the latest trends. Some ideas that could help to keep people employed include: 
1) More job flexibility – as technology advances, it becomes easier and more affordable for people to change their working hours or locations whenever they feel like it. This means that there are more opportunities for people to work from home, which can be a great way to stay on top of your schedule and stay organized. 
2) Better communication between employers and employees – not everyone needs the same level of communication when it comes to working with their boss.
