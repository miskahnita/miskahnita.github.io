Brainstroming is a technique used in business to improve decision making. The brainstem is the part of the brain that controls heart rate, breathing, and other basic bodily functions. When a business owner uses brainstroming, they can better understand their customer’s needs and determine what changes need to be made to meet those needs. This allows businesses to make informed decisions, which in turn leads to increased profits.

The power of suggestion
Creative ideas are the key to any business or project. When you have a good idea, it's easy to set out to find someone who can help turn that into a reality. Whether you're looking for help with your creative vision or just some recommendations for new companies or products, giving people the opportunity to suggest ideas is one of the most important tools you have in your toolbox.
There are a few things you need in order to give people the opportunity to suggest ideas: first, an idea must be something that someone really wants and desires. Second, it needs to be something that they think could benefit others. And finally, it needs to be something that they think would be interesting and potentially useful for your project or business.
