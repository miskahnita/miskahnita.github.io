Creativity and art: Definition, difference, examples.
Creativity and art are two very different things. One could say that creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas, while art is the creation of art. There are many examples of creativity in everyday life, from making a cake to painting a picture. However, it is interesting to explore what makes creativity so unique.
Different people have different opinions on what constitutes as creative art. Some might call it simply creating something original, while others might refer to it as using your imagination to create something beautiful or powerful. Whether or not you believe in this definition entirely depends on who you ask. What we can do though is provide someamples of creativity that have been influential in our lives.

Patenting andprotecting inventions
Patents protect inventions from being infringing by others. Patent applications are often filled out in a variety of different ways, including but not limited to, the following: 
-Inventor biography 
-Chemical formula 
-Description of invention 
-Problem to be solved 
-Steps and method for solving the problem 
-Grant of patent 
When an inventor fills out a patent application, they are typically taking on a lot of risk. They could potentially face lawsuits if their invention is copied or used without permission. To help protect their invention, many inventors choose to patent their ideas instead of just selling them outright. By filing a patent application, an inventor is able to make sure that their invention is protected from infringement and can also get feedback from potential customers or partners about how their product might work.
