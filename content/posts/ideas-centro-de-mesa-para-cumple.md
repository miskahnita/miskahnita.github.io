History of Invention: How did invention come about?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea or product that had not been considered before. Invention has been around for centuries, and it began with the Greeks. In their manual The Iliad, Homer mentions the invention of the bow and arrow, which he says was created by Menelaus. Other ancient authors also mention the invention of new technologies. For example, Theophrastus wrote about a machine that could turn any object into wine, which he called the “Wine Maker”. The Chinese also invented various products such as silkworm cocoons and books in the 4th century BC.

The impact of invention on society: from novelties to products that saved lives or made a difference
Invention has exploded in recent years as new and innovative technologies have led to products that have made a difference in society. Some of these products have saved lives, such as the iPhone and the Nike sneaker, while others have made a small impact, such as the solar cooker or the artificial intelligence development. However, no product has had a lasting impact on society like the invention of the printing press. The printing press allowed for books to be printed one letter at a time which led to increased communication and helped create an understanding of complex topics across cultures.

Invention ideas can be as simple as a new product or as complex as a new way to do an old thing. Whatever the invention, there are a few things that must be true in order for it to be called an invention. First, the invention must be novel and not already in use. Second, the invention must be useful, and third, the innovation must improve upon an existing product or method.
