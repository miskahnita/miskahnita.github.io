Definition of innovation: How does it differ from traditional methods and products?
Innovation is the process of introducing a new product or method to improve the efficiency and quality of an existing product. It can be defined in many ways, but one definition defines it as follows: "the creation of a new idea, design, technology, or business model that replaces an older one." Innovation can come from anywhere in the organization, but it often happens in those areas that are closest to customers and users. Innovation is the heart of any company's success, and it's what allows them to stay ahead of the competition.
