The four types of creativity: Visual, auditory, kinesthetic, and olfactory.
Creative art is something that helps to express yourself and your thoughts. There are four different types of creativity which can be expressed through visual, auditory, kinesthetic, and olfactory means. Each type of creative expression has its own strengths and weaknesses. Visual creativity is often seen as the most direct form of creative expression.
