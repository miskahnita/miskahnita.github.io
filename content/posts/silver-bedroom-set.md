what is innovation?
Innovation is a term used to describe the application of new ideas, methods or products. It includes both the process of creating new ideas and the implementation of those ideas into practice. Innovation is often used in business to refer to the process of introducing new products or services. However, it can also refer to improving existing products or services, as well as developing new processes or ways of doing things.
There are many different types of innovation, but all share a common goal: to create something new or improve upon something that already exists. The process of innovation typically begins with an idea. This can come from anywhere – an individual, a team, a company, or even a country. Once an idea has been generated, it must be developed and tested before it can be implemented. This process can take years, and sometimes even decades, to complete.

Inventions have the potential to change how people live, work, and play and can make the world a better place. Some embodiments of this idea are more tangible than others, but all inventions offer potential for change.
