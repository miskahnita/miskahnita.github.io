Conclusion: The Benefits of Innovation
Innovation is critical to success in today’s economy. By definition, innovation is the introduction of something new – whether it’s a new product, service, process or business model. And while some businesses are born innovative, others have to work hard to embed a culture of innovation into their organization.
There are many benefits of being an innovative company. Perhaps the most important is that it allows you to stay ahead of the competition. It also makes you more attractive to investors and customers alike. And lastly, it fosters creativity and employee engagement.

So how do you foster a culture of innovation? First, you need to start with the right mindset. Encourage your team to think outside the box and challenge the status quo. Then, create an environment that supports risk-taking and failure.

The importance of creativity: What are we trying to accomplish with creativity?
Creativity is important in many ways. It allows people to come up with new ideas and solutions that may not have been thought of before. Additionally, creativity can be used to improve personal relationships and businesses. However, without proper creativity, some things may not go as planned. For example, if a business does not have fresh and innovative ideas, their customers may be less likely to return or recommend them to others. In order to create lasting memories and successes, businesses must start by cultivating creativity in their employees and directors.

What Causes Innovation?
Innovation can be explained in a few ways. One way is to say that innovation comes from change. Another way to think about it is that innovation happens when something new and different comes along and helps someone or something do what they were supposed to do but didn't actually do it. 
One of the biggest reasons for innovation is often because someone needs a new product or service to solve a problem that they didn't previously have. Innovation also happens when people come up with new ways of doing things, or coming up with new ways to make things better.
