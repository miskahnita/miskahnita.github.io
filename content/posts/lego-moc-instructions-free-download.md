Definition of big ideas: What is it, and why should we care?
The definition of big ideas can vary greatly, but typically they refer to ideas that could have a significant impact on society or the world. Big ideas are usually long-term and require thought and effort to put into fruition, so they're important not just for businesses but also for government and social organizations. Here are five definitions of big ideas that may help make them more clear:
1) A big idea is an innovative solution or plan that has the potential to change the way people live, work, and play.
2) A big idea is a new way of thinking about something that's been around for a while but hasn't been fully explored.
3) An idea with potential to create jobs, boost economy, or improve education is often called a big idea. 
4) Ideas with significant implications for individuals or groups are also considered big ideas.

How to Choose the rightDIY Project:
Choosing the right DIY project is important, especially if you want to create something for your own pleasure or use it as a learning opportunity. Here are four tips to help make the process easier:
1. Decide what you want your project to achieve. If you’re looking to make a simple change to your home or improve an existing piece of furniture, there are many possibilities out there. However, if you’re planning on creating something more comprehensive or complex, be sure to research the different types of dyes and materials before starting.

2. Consider your budget. Just because you can do something yourself doesn’t mean that it’s a good idea. Factor in both the cost of materials and the time it will take to complete your project.

The three types of big ideas: A crazy idea, a good idea, and a bad idea
There are three types of big ideas: crazy, good, and bad. Crazy ideas are always exciting, and can help to change the course of history. Good ideas have the potential to make a big impact on people and the world. However, there is always risk associated with them- some might be great, while others might not be so great after all. But when it comes time to make a decision, it’s important to weigh the risks and benefits of each idea before coming up with a decision.
Bad Ideas are simply terrible, and often have no chance of becoming anything other than infamous failures. They may seem like something that could never work or might even lead to disaster- but in reality, they often do just that. It’s important to be vigilant when assessing any new idea- especially those with such potential for disaster.
