How innovation happens
Innovation is not a one time event or process. It is an ongoing, continuous journey that starts with a thought and ends with a new product or service. Innovation is about taking risks and looking for potential solutions to problems. Innovation can be found in everything from the smallest details of how we interact with the world to the largest ideas in business.

Innovation has been a key component of human civilization for centuries, and it continues to play a role today.

The environment: How will we handle the increasing amount of pollution?
In an effort to save the planet, many people are trying to devise new ways of living that do not rely on traditional methods of production. One such way is using green technology. 
One idea that has been gaining attention is the use of clean energy sources like solar and wind power. These sources provide clean energy that can be used to produce electricity without causing any pollution. 

It is important to note that these types of technologies are still in their development and will likely have a longer timeline before they are fully implemented on a large scale. However, if done correctly, these types of technologies could help us avoid some of the biggest pollutants on Earth.

History of innovation:
The history of innovation is filled with stories of people who have inspired and changed the way we live and work. Some of these innovative thinkers have had a lasting impact on society, while others have faded into obscurity. But all of them have left their mark on history in some way. Here are 5 examples.
1) Johannes Gutenberg's invention of the movable type press in 1455 led to the printing press and the rise of printing technology as an important part of modern society.

2) In 1876, Bell Labs invented the telephone, which made communication much more accessible than it had been before.

3) The internet was first created in 1972 by mathematician Alain Robert et al., which allowed for greater access to information and education than ever before.
