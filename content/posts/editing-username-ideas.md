Invention is the process of coming up with a new solution to a problem. Technology is the application of knowledge in order to achieve an end or result. The two are often used interchangeably, but there is a major difference between them.

What inspired the inventor to invent their particular invention?
Inventors often have a specific idea in mind when they come up with their invention. It can be anything from a new product to a new way of doing something. Sometimes, an inventor's idea is just too good to ignore. That's what happened to Northrop Grumman Aeronautics company founder Robert Northrop. He came up with the design for the first jet engine in the 1920s, but it wasn't until he patented it that he got his name recognition and fortune.

What are big ideas?
Big ideas are important, and they can help spur new thought and innovation. Here are some of the most common big ideas:
1. We can all be more creative. big ideas can come from anywhere, but creativity is often found in the imagination. The more we can tap into our creativity, the better we'll be able to think of new ways to improve things.

2. There's no one right way to do something. Just because something seems impossible or impossible-minded, that doesn't mean it isn't possible or reasonable to try out for a change. A big idea is just a suggestion - so try out different ideas until you find the one that works best for you and your situation.

3. Disruptive innovation is key to success in any industry.

The future of transportation
The future of transportation is anything but what it seems at first glance. The world is about to see a day where people can move around without needing a car, and that’s just the beginning. In fact, many experts say that the days of driving to work or school are numbered. Instead, people will be able to rely on ride-sharing, bikepacking, and other forms of transportation to get around. With these changes in the near future, it will be hard for drivers to remain dominant in the industry.

Overcoming the challenges of bringing a big idea to life
There are many challenges that come with bringing a big idea to life. The first challenge is often just getting started. It can be difficult to take that first step, but it's important to remember that every journey begins with a single step. Once you've taken that first step, the next challenge is often keeping your motivation high. It's easy to get discouraged when you encounter setbacks, but it's important to keep your eye on the prize and remember why you're doing this in the first place. Finally, another common challenge is maintaining momentum. It can be difficult to keep moving forward when you're feeling bogged down or burned out, but it's important to push through and keep your energy up. These are just some of the challenges you may face when bringing a big idea to life, but if you stay focused and committed, you can overcome them and achieve your goals.
