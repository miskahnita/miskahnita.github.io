How do you come up with new ideas?
As a creative thinker, you face many challenges when coming up with new ideas. One challenge is that it can be difficult to remember just what worked the last time you came up with an idea. Additionally, it can be difficult to come up with novel approaches to problem solving.  So how do you come up with new ideas? 
One approach is to brainstorm. By brainstorming, you can get rid of any old ideas and start from scratch. Additionally, by using headphones or other distractions, you can create an environment in which you are unable to think of any other ideas. Finally, if you have a specific idea in mind but are not sure how to bring it to life, then you can try outframing or milking an existing idea for new potential insights.

Definition of innovation:
Innovation is the process of bringing new ideas or products to market using creative and efficient methods. Innovation can be found in any industry, but typically it refers to technology, business, and product innovation.
There are many ways to define innovation, but one way that has become increasingly important is the definition provided by Matt Ridley in his book "The Innovator's Dilemma." Ridley defines innovation as a state of mind: "Innovation always means change, not just alteration of what has been done before." He goes on to say that innovation should be based on the following four factors: creativity, efficiency, novelty, and sustainability.

Creativity is a necessary component of any innovation process; without it, ideas will likely not make it past the initial stages of development.

The types of creative art
Creative art is a form of expression that is unique to the individual. There are many different types of creative art, each with its own purpose and meaning.
Some common types of creative art include painting, sculpture, photography, and music. Each type of art has its own way of conveying emotion and ideas. Painting, for example, can be used to express feelings or tell a story. Sculpture can be used to create a physical representation of an idea or feeling. Photography can capture a moment in time and Music can convey emotion and tell a story.
