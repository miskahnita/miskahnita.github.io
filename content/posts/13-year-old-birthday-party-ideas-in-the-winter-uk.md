How to generate Big Ideas: How do you generate big ideas?
There is no one-size-fits-all answer to the question of how to generate big ideas, but there are a few key things to keep in mind. The first is that different people have different ways of generating ideas. Some people prefer to think out loud, while others prefer writing down their thoughts. It doesn’t matter what type of idea you come up with – just be sure that it’s something that you can actually put into action and make a difference in your life. 
The second thing to note is that big ideas don’t always have to come from scratch. Sometimes, you can take what you know and use it to help develop new ideas. For example, if you know that you could improve your business by creating more customer service skills, then you might want to start thinking about how you can do this.

Ideas: What are some good ideas?
Creative ideas are always a great way to come up with new ideas and improve current ones. Here are a few ideas that may help you get started:
1. Create a new project or idea. This can be anything from designing a new shirt to coming up with a new business model. Just be sure that your idea is both innovative and feasible, as there is no guarantee that it will be accepted.

2. Take on an existing project. If your idea isn’t very different from what someone else has already done, it might be worth considering taking on an existing project. This can give you some experience and knowledge in the area in which you want to focus your efforts, as well as the support of other people who might have an expertise in that area.

3. Try out different methods ofexpression.
