Think outside the box: when it comes to problem-solving, there’s no limit to what you can imagine. come up with concepts or products that have never been thought of before.

The computer: How it was invented and how it has changed
In 1876, American inventors Charles Babbage and Herman Hollerith created the first mechanical computers. These early machines were complex and expensive, and they could only be used by trained mathematicians and engineers. In 1937, British mathematician Alan Turing published a paper that described how a machine could be built to perform any type of calculation. Turing's paper inspired many scientists and engineers to begin work on electronic computers. In 1941, German engineer Konrad Zuse designed and built the first programmable computer. The first computers were large, expensive, and used vacuum tubes for circuitry.

The benefits of big ideas
Big ideas are the life blood of any business. They provide a new idea or solution to a problem that can create new opportunities or generate new revenue. Big ideas are what drive innovation and creativity, and they can help companies grow and succeed. Here are four benefits of big ideas:
1. They inspire others to think differently about their own deeds and possibilities.

When someone has a big idea, it takes the pressure off them to come up with something original and exciting. This opens up more opportunities for discussion and collaboration, which can lead to better ideas and faster progress. It also gives people an incentive to take risks and push boundaries, which can lead to even more innovative products or services.

2. They foster team spirit.

Big ideas promote teamwork by giving everyone a chance to contribute in a meaningful way.
