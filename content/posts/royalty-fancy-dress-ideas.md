Conclusion: Some tips for coming up with creative ideas.
Creative ideas can be a great way to get your creative juices flowing and come up with new ideas for products or services. Here are a few tips to help you come up with creative ideas:
1. Brainstorm with others: When brainstorming, it is helpful to take turns sharing your ideas. This will allow you to gain feedback and improve on what you’re thinking.

2. Use analogies and metaphors: Analogies and metaphors are powerful tools for coming up with new ideas. For example, if you’re brainstorming product concepts, you might compare a toy to a Ferrari or a computer game to the cockpit of an airplane.

3. Take advantage of opportunity: Opportunity is the key to creativity, and taking advantage of it will help you come up with more creative solutions than you would have otherwise thought possible.

Natural gas: The inventor's story
Invention is a process of creating something new from personal experience, creativity, and the applied sciences. Natural gas is an example of an invention that has impacted the world in a significant way. In 1929, John D. Rockefeller Jr. discovered natural gas reserves in Pennsylvania and began developing them into a field known as The Marcellus Shale. The Marcellus Shale was developed to create energy that could be used to power factories and homes; it was also used to produce plastics and other industrial materials. With the rise of renewables such as solar and wind, gasification of natural resources is becoming an increasingly important technique for powering these systems.
