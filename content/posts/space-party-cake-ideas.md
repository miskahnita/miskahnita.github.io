Printing press
In 1439, Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press, which revolutionized how information was disseminated. For the first time in history, knowledge was not restricted to those who could read and write; it could be shared with anyone who could operate a printing press. The ability to mass-produce printed materials quickly and cheaply made it possible for people to access a wide range of information that was previously only available to a select few.
The invention of the printing press had a profound impact on society. It allowed for the rapid spread of ideas and knowledge, and played a key role in shaping the course of history. Today, the printing press is an essential tool for businesses, schools, and individuals around the world.

Creative egg: What is a creative idea?
Creative ideas are a way to get your creative juices flowing. Whether it’s coming up with an idea for a new project or coming up with ways to improve an existing one, creativity is key. However, not all creative ideas are good. Here are five examples of the worst creative ideas you could come up with:
1. Coming up with a name for your business that is unique and not easily copied
2. Planning to travel to every corner of the world and never leave your house
3. Coming up with a unique advice column that will be popular and useful
4. Creating an app that can be used by anyone, regardless of their skill level

Brainstorming techniques
If you're stuck on how to generate creative ideas, try some of these brainstorming techniques:
1. Freewriting: Set a timer for 5-10 minutes and write nonstop about your topic. Don't worry about grammar or whether what you're writing makes sense. The goal is to get as many ideas down on paper as possible.

2. Brainstorming with someone else: Collaborating with someone can help stimulate new ideas. Throw around some potential ideas with a colleague or friend and see what they come up with.

3. Taking a walk: Sometimes the best way to clear your head and get some fresh perspective is to take a break from work altogether. Go for a walk outside and let your mind wander. You may be surprised at the new ideas that come to you when you're not even trying to think of them!

This can be done through a number of different means, such as designing or building something from scratch.
