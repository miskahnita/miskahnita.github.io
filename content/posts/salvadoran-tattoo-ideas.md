Invention: How did one person come up with an idea that led to a new product or technology?
An inventor is someone who comes up with an idea for a new product or technology. It can be something as simple as coming up with a new way to cook food, or inventing a new alloy that can be used in metalworking. In some cases, an inventor may develop the idea while working on another project, and then take it further by working on the details until they come up with a product or technology that they think will be useful. Some inventors are also able to come up with ideas while they are away from their home country, or during off-hours at work.

The history and definition of creative art: Creative art can be defined as any art which is created with the intention to communicate a message or create a piece that has a unique aesthetic.
Creative art has been around for centuries, and has gradually evolved over time. Initially, creative art was only used for religious or spiritual purposes, but as time passed it became increasingly common to see creative art used in everyday life. Today, creative art is widely accepted and enjoyed by all. There are many different types of creative art, and each has its own unique abilities and benefits.
One of the most important factors in determining whether or not creativity is present in any given piece of creative art is the artist’s intention. If an artist is simply trying to communicate a message or create an experience that is enjoyable, then their work will likely be considered creative. However, if the artist is trying to create something that is new and exciting, then their work will likely fall into the category of creative art.
