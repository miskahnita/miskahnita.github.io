Creative artists: How many there are and what makes them special?
Creative artists are an often overlooked but important part of the art world. They come from many different backgrounds and have a range of different skills and techniques. Some are able to use their creative abilities to create beautiful or powerful artwork, while others specialize in specific genres or styles. However, all artists have something special that sets them apart from other artists. Here are four examples: 
Allison Bechdel is a well-known cartoonist who specializes in creation of humorous strips about female characters, which has made her one of the most recognizable and popular comic book authors of all time; performance artist Grant Wood created memorable posters and paintings during the Depression era that stand as benchmarks for American artistry; and David Stone Martin is known for his dramatic story-telling with his unique use of sound and light.

Invention is a process of creating something new and often involving the use of an unknown or unusual tool. Many inventions have originated from the simplest concepts, such as a design for a shirt that was first conceived by a tailor. Other inventions, like the transistor, were created through years of trial and error before they were finally realized in devices such as radios and TVs. Inventions can be so important to our society that they are often consideredtreasures, and some have even been donated to universities or used in scientific research.
