Defining big ideas
There are a lot of big ideas out there. But what exactly are they? And how can we define them?
A big idea is an overarching concept or theme that is central to a work of art, literature, or philosophy. It is usually something that the author wants to communicate to the audience, and it can be interpreted in many ways.

One way to think of a big idea is as a symbol or motif that represents something larger than itself. For example, in the novel The Great Gatsby, the green light on Daisy Buchanan’s dock represents hope and possibility. In Shakespeare’s play Romeo and Juliet, the balcony scene is a symbol of young love and its potential for tragedy.

Another way to define a big idea is as an abstract concept that can be explored in different ways.

How to write good content
Contentwriting isn't a one-time event. It's an ongoing, ongoing process that you can use to improve the quality of your website and increase viewership for your content. Below are some tips on how to write good content and increase viewership for your website or blog: 
1) Start with a strong opener. Your opening sentence should introduce the reader to your topic and help them understand what you're about. 

2) Use verbs correctly. Each verb needs a specific action to complete the sentence, so make sure all verbs are used correctly in your opening paragraph. For example, "I eat," "I play," "I watch." 

3) Use clear language. Your language should be easy to understand and use on a daily basis. Avoid overusing words or adjectives in your writing; they'll sound automated instead of interesting or engaging.

The role of invention in society: What are the biggest uses for innovation in society today?
Innovation has long been a key component of society. From the development of new technology to the improvement of food production, innovation has always been essential in order to keep society running smoothly and ensuring that everyone has access to the basics. 
However, there are a number of other spheres in which innovation can be used in society. For example, innovations in healthcare could lead to better treatments for patients and lessened costs; or innovations in transportation could make it easier for people to reach their destinations safely and efficiently. 

There is no one answer to whether or not innovation is important in society, but it is worth looking at how it can be used in different ways in order to ensure that everyone benefits from its impact.
