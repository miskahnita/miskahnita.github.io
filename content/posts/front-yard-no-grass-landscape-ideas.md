Invention ideas can come from anywhere, at any time. The key is to recognize them and act on them. However, there are some obstacles that may prevent you from coming up with a great invention idea. Here are a few tips on how to overcome those obstacles:

2) Talk to people who are knowledgeable about the area you're interested in. They may have some great insights that you hadn't considered before.
