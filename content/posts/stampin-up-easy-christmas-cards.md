defines what invention ideas are
The definition of an invention idea is up to the inventor. 
There are many different ways to create and patented inventions, so it is important to determine what type of invention you are thinking of creating. There are four main types of inventions: 
1) Product: A product is a physical object that a customer buys or uses. This could be anything from a new appliance to a new car. 
2) Process: This could be anything from baking soda to driving in rain. Inventions that improve or change the way products are made are often called process patents. 
3) Service: Service patents cover ideas that improve the service industry, such as making it easier for customers to find information or resolving problems faster. 
4) Technology: This could include anything from computers to air travel.
