Types of creativity: Visual, auditory, kinaesthetic, and gestural.
Creativity is a two-fold process. There are creative visual and auditory experiences, as well as creative gestural experiences. Gestural creativity refers to the ability to create unique or innovative designs through the use of gestures. Gestural creativity can be seen in artists such as Michelangelo and Vincent van Gogh, who were known for their innovation in artistry. Visual creativity is when an artist creates a piece of art by using their eyesight and vision. This can be seen in paintings such as Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa, Caravaggio’s The Nude Descending from the Cross, and Picasso’s Guernica. Artists use their eyesight to see what they want to create, and then use their imagination to make it real. Audiogenic creativity is when an artist creates a piece of art by using sound instead of sight.

History of Invention: How did inventors come up with new ideas?
Invention ideas come from many different sources, but the most common origins are as a result of inspiration or thought. Inventions can come in many forms- from simple devices to complex machines. Sometimes, an idea for a new product is born out of pure boredom or curiosity. Other times, an inventor may simply have the perfect solution to a problem that he or she has been experiencing. Whatever the case may be, history has shown that inventors often come up with new ideas based on their own experiences and observations.
