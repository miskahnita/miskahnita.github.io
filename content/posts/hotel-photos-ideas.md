Winter weather: Tips to keep your home warm
If you're like most people, you probably think of winter as the time when your house is cold and unused. But that's not always the case. In fact, there are a few things you can do to keep your home warm during the winter. Here are some tips:
1) Keep your windows open at all times. This will let in natural sunlight, which will help keep your home warm.
2) Use a fireplace or heat pad. Fires add warmth to any space, and they also emit noxious gases which can help block out wind noise and cold air from coming in.
3) Place an electric blanket over every piece of furniture in your room. This will place an electric field between yourself and the elements, which will help keep you warm (or cooler) during the winter months.

How Invention ranges from ancient to modern
Invention has been around for centuries, with some of the earliest examples dating back to ancient Greece. Inventions that have shaped the modern world include the telephone, car, and air conditioning – all of which were created in the 19th century. However, some inventions are much older than that and predate even humanity. For example, the wheel was first invented by a man named Pangloss in 4500 BC.
