What is brainstroming and what does it do?
Brainstroming is a new way of thinking that promises to change the way we think about intelligence and creativity. It is a form of mental gymnastics that uses brain waves to improve problem-solving skills.

The different types of creative art
There are many different types of creative art. Some people may think of art as paintings in a museum, while others may think of it as the music they listen to on the radio. Creative art can be anything that someone creates that is intended to be beautiful or expressive. Here are some of the different types of creative art:
Painting: Painting is one of the most popular forms of creative art. People have been painting for centuries, and there are many different styles and techniques that can be used. If you're interested in painting, you can learn about different brushstrokes and color theory to create beautiful works of art.

Sculpture: Sculpture is another popular form of creative art. Unlike painting, sculpture is three-dimensional, so it can be touched and interacted with.
