Some new ideas are born out of necessity, such as in the case of a product that needs to be small enough to carry without being cumbersome, but too large or expensive to create a viable business model around. Other ideas may come from looking at what others are doing and seeing how they could be improved.

The benefits of innovation
Innovation is a key aspect of business success. It allows businesses to improve their products and services, and provides them with new ideas for how to do things. In addition, innovation can help businesses capitalize on new technologies and updates to their own infrastructure. By improving the way that they use technology, businesses can save money and increase efficiency.
Innovation is also a key factor in creating jobs. By making improvements to their products or services, businesses can create new positions for people who are capable of doing work that once required an advanced degree or experience. Innovation also helps businesses increase production by making changes to their plants or methods of producing goods. In turn, this can lead to increased profits and more jobs overall.
