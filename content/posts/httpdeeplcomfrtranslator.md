Invention ideas range from the simple to the impossible. Sometimes, just thinking of a new idea can lead to new solutions to old problems. Whatever your invention idea, don't be afraid to try and come up with a working prototype so you can see if it actually works. There's no shame in starting with the simplest solution and seeing how it goes from there.

Patenting an invention: How do you do it?
Patenting an invention is a common process used by businesses to protect their ideas and protect them from others who may want to use them without permission. There are several ways to do this, and the most important part is to find the right method for you and your business. Inventors should also be careful when patenting their ideas as they could face infringement lawsuits if someone else uses them without giving credit or sharing in profits.

History of innovation:
The history of innovation is filled with stories of people who have inspired and changed the way we live and work. Some of these innovative thinkers have had a lasting impact on society, while others have faded into obscurity. But all of them have left their mark on history in some way. Here are 5 examples.
1) Johannes Gutenberg's invention of the movable type press in 1455 led to the printing press and the rise of printing technology as an important part of modern society.

2) In 1876, Bell Labs invented the telephone, which made communication much more accessible than it had been before.

3) The internet was first created in 1972 by mathematician Alain Robert et al., which allowed for greater access to information and education than ever before.
