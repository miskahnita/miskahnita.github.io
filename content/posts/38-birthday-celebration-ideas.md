The different ways in which creativity can be used in art: To create atmosphere, mood, or story
There are numerous ways in which creativity can be used in art, from creating atmosphere to mood to story. Here are four examples:
1. Atmosphere: by adding a sense of calm or excitement, an artist can create a believable and distracting environment for the viewer to inhabit.
2. Mood: by using different colors and brushstrokes, an artist can create a range of emotions that can be manipulated through composition and color alone.
3. Storytelling: by weaving together disparate elements into one story or plot, an artist can create engaging and dimensional work that becomes both memorable and unforgettable.

Experiments: What do you do when you have no idea what to do?

But what if you don't have any experience or knowledge to offer? What if you're completely clueless of what you should do? Then you might be in for a quite unique predicament.
