The difference between left brain and right brain thinking:
Most people use both sides of their brain for thinking, but some people tend to use one side more than the other. Left-brain thinkers are usually more logical and analytical, while right-brain thinkers are usually more creative.
Left-brain thinkers tend to be better at things like math and science, because they can break things down into smaller pieces and see the logic behind them. Right-brain thinkers tend to be better at things like art and music, because they can see the big picture and come up with creative ideas.

Both types of thinking are important, and most people use both sides of their brain for different tasks. But if you want to be good at something that requires creativity, then you’ll need to learn how to use your right brain more.

Economic Applications of Invention
Invention has a broad range of economic applications, from making new products to improving the efficiency of businesses. Inventions can also have a significant impact on the economy as a whole, depending on their potential uses and impacts. Here are some examples: 
1. Invention can help improve the quality of products. For example, an invention that makes products more healthy or less risky could lead to increased sales and reduce risks associated with manufacturing processes. 
2. Invention can help increase efficiency in businesses. For example, an invention that makes it easier to track expenses or get information from suppliers could lead to faster delivery times and reduced costs for businesses. 
3. Invention can create new markets for products or services. For example, an invention that creates a new type of clothing could bring in new customers and make it more difficult for rivals to compete against him/her.
