If you're looking for ways to make your home more comfortable, there are a variety of ways to go about it. Here are a few tips to get the most out of your comfort zone:

4. Install an air conditioner in winter if you can't find one outside or add window AC if that's an option for you. 
5. Get a recliner or rocker for relaxation in the living room or bedroom instead of just sitting on the floor all day long!
