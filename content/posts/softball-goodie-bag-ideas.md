What is the new idea?
The new idea is to use a smartwatch as a fitness tracker. People wear trackers all the time, so why not wear one on their wrist? This would be great for people who are already healthy and want to keep track of their fitness and activity levels. Another benefit of this technology is that it could be used as a communication device. You could use it to text or call someone while you are working out, or even while you are lying in bed.
