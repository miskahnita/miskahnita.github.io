Section 3: Tips for stimulating your creativity.
If you're feeling stuck in a creative rut, these tips will help jumpstart your brainstorming sessions and get the ideas flowing again.
1. Take a break from your usual routine and try something new. Getting out of your comfort zone can open up your mind to new possibilities.

2. Set some structure for your brainstorming session by coming up with a specific goal or challenge to focus on. Having a clear objective will help you generate more targeted ideas.

3. Brainstorm with someone else to get fresh perspectives on how to approach the problem you're trying to solve. Collaborating with others can also help spark new ideas that you wouldn't have thought of on your own.
