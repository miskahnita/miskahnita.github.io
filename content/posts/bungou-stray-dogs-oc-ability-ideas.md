Repainting a Room: Tips and tricks for painting a room successfully.
If you‚Äôre looking to spruce up your living room or bedroom, there are a few easy tricks to help out. Here are a few tips to repaint your room successfully:
1) Start with the basics: Paint the walls first and then the ceiling. This will give your painting project a more unified feel.

2) Use a light color for each area of the room: If you want your walls to be in one color, use that color in all of your walls. If you want your ceilings and floors to be different colors, start with one color and add other shades as needed.

3) Don‚Äôt forget about trim: Wipe down any debris that may have built up on the wallpapers or flooring, and try to get rid of any excess paint.
