Brainstroming is a new way of thinking that promises to change the way we think about intelligence and creativity. It is a form of mental gymnastics that uses brain waves to improve problem-solving skills. The theory behind brainstroming is that by focusing on certain patterns and ideas, we can improve our thinking skills and increase our creativity.
