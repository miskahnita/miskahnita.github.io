Definition of Innovation: Ideas that improve the quality, efficiency, or effectiveness of life
Innovation is the process of developing a new product, service, or idea that improves quality, efficiency, or effectiveness. Innovation ideas can be specific to a certain industry or field, but they also have the potential to be applied to any area of life. 
One example of an innovation that has been implemented successfully in many industries is the automobile. The development and implementation of efficient and effective car engines has led to increased speeds and efficiency on the road. Another example is the internet. The early days were difficult for website designers because no one had a clear definition of what “web design” meant. However, as technology evolved and more people became comfortable using computers, websites started popping up all over the place. As a result, web design has become one of the most popular areas for innovation today.
