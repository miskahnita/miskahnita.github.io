Creative juices: How creativity flows through our veins
Creativity is one of the most powerful forces in our lives. It can help us see things in a new way, inspire us to create, and connect with others. But just how creativity flows through our veins? And what role does it play in our lives?
According to a study by University of Edinburgh researchers, creativity is passed down from parents to children through their blood pressure levels. When the parents had high blood pressure levels, they were more creative than when they had low blood pressure levels. This finding suggests that creativity is a natural part of human nature and can be passed down through the generations.

Other studies have also shown that creativity is connected with stress levels. If people are under stress, they are less creative than if they are not under stress. This suggests that stress can influence how creative we become.

How can people start thinking about new ideas?
Most people think of ideas when they are brainstorming, but there are other ways to come up with new ideas. Sometimes all you need is a new perspective. Here are three tips to help you get started: 
1. Give yourself time: Sometimes the best way to come up with new ideas is to allow yourself time to think about them. Don’t try to come up with any ideas in an instant. Take your time and consider everything that you have said before coming up with a new idea. 

2. Be open-minded: Once you have considered some potential ideas, it’s important that you be open-minded about them. If something doesn’t sound right or feels too farfetched, don’t be afraid to change your mind after thinking about it more. Remember that every idea has at least one potential application.
