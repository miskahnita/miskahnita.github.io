Impact of innovation on society and economy:
Innovation is an ever-growing movement in the economy that leads to new products, services and businesses. It is also a key factor in society; innovations often lead to changes in social norms and the way people interact. The impact of innovation on society and economy has been studied for many years and there are some clear conclusions about what types of innovation have the biggest impact. 
One clear conclusion is that innovative activity can have a significant positive impact on society if it meets three conditions: it should be done in a way that does not harm others, it should be affordable for everyone, and it should be able to create jobs. However, even when innovations meet these conditions, they can still have a negative impact on society if they do not meet other specific requirements.

What are big ideas?
Big ideas are important, but they can be hard to come by. Here are some tips on finding big ideas that will help you succeed: 
1. Define what you want your business to achieve. Once you have a clear idea of what your business wants to accomplish, it's easier to come up with ideas for how to achieve it. 
2. Think about who your target market is. Big businesses often think about their target market as all the people who are potential customers or employees who might be interested in their product or service. However, there are also many people out there who don't have a specific interest in your product or service, and you need to include them in your thinking while developing your big idea. 
3. Create a vision and mission statement.

The benefits of big ideas
Big ideas are the life blood of any business. They provide a new idea or solution to a problem that can create new opportunities or generate new revenue. Big ideas are what drive innovation and creativity, and they can help companies grow and succeed. Here are four benefits of big ideas:
1. They inspire others to think differently about their own deeds and possibilities.

When someone has a big idea, it takes the pressure off them to come up with something original and exciting. This opens up more opportunities for discussion and collaboration, which can lead to better ideas and faster progress. It also gives people an incentive to take risks and push boundaries, which can lead to even more innovative products or services.

2. They foster team spirit.

Big ideas promote teamwork by giving everyone a chance to contribute in a meaningful way.
