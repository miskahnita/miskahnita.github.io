Creativedesigners on the go
Creativedesigners are on the go, and that means they need to be creative when it comes to their work. Whether they're working from home or on the go, creativity is key to success. Here are four ways creative designers can keep their work organized and on track:
1. Create a To-Do List: A to-do list can help keep things organized and on track. Not only does it make life easier, but keeping a to-do list can also help you stay inspired as you work.

2. Use NiceNotes: Another great way to keep things organized is using NiceNotes. Not only do they look pretty, but they also have a variety of uses (such as for brainstorming).

3. Keep Workspaces Clean: One way to stay focused while working is by keeping your workspace clean.

Definition of creativity: How does it differ from other forms of creative expression?
Creativity has been defined in many ways over time, but there is one common thread that runs through all of them: creativity is a process. In order to be creative, you have to be open to change and new ideas. This opens up the door for all sorts of possibilities, from the simple to the complex.
To put it another way, creativity is not just thinking outside the box; it's also feeling out new ideas and coming up with new ways to express yourself. It can be hard to maintain this level of energy for long, but with a little bit of effort and dedication, you can make your creativeexpression thrive.
