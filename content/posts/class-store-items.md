The definition of creative art and how it has no limits
Creative art has no definitive answer or meaning. It is art that is created from the imagination, emotions, and thoughts of an artist. It can be anything that the artist wants it to be, and there are no limits on what can be considered creative art.
Some people may say that creative art is only valid if it is created with a certain purpose or meaning in mind, but that is not the case. The beauty of creative art is that it can be whatever the artist wants it to be, and there are no rules or boundaries that need to be followed.

The sky's the limit when it comes to creative art, and that's what makes it so special. Anyone can create something beautiful and unique, regardless of their skill level or experience.

Invention as a process: How does one come up with new ideas?
One important step in the process of coming up with new ideas is to have a brainstorm. A brainstorming session is an opportunity for individuals to come up with new ideas without having to worry about whether or not they will be accepted. By using a brainstorming session, you can quickly and easily come up with new ideas that could potentially solve a problem. 
The best way to create a good brainstorming session is by creating a agenda beforehand and setting boundaries for who can participate. You should also make sure that everyone has something they are willing to share, so that everyone has an equal say in the discussion. It is important to do this because it will help free up energy and allow everyone to focus on their individual Ideas rather than worrying about how others might react. Once you have started the meeting, it’s important to give everyone some time before taking any decisions.
