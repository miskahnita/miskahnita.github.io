Challenges and opportunities for innovation: What are they?
Innovation can be defined as change that brings new opportunities or changes to the way something is done. It can also refer to technological and scientific innovation, which has helped humankind improve their lives in myriad ways. 
Challenges and opportunities for innovation abound, but often times there are unique challenges that need to be addressed in order to achieve the desired outcomes. For example, advances in robotics are resulting in increased flexibility and dexterity for workers; however, such advancements also present challenges with safety and workmanship. In this way, innovation can result in both positive and negative consequences for businesses and individuals alike. 

Furthermore, it is important for businesses to be aware of the opportunity cost associated with any type of innovation. When a company invests time or resources into an innovative idea, it can result in a higher return on investment (ROI).
