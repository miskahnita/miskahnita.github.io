- Service: This is the idea of what a service is and how it works. It could be anything from providing customer support to doing your own research for an assignment.

Creative people can be counted on one hand. They're the ones who come up with new ways to do things, the ones who come up with ideas for new products or services. Sometimes their creativity is in the form of new ways to look at old things, or a new way to approach an old problem. Creative people can be found all over the place, but there are two key types of creative people - those who come up with ideas and those who come up with products.

Introduce the topic of invention.
Invention is the process or art of creating something new, whether it is a physical object, a piece of software, or a process. It is an important part of human history and has played a significant role in our development as a species.
Invention is not just about coming up with something new; it is also about improving upon existing ideas and technologies. This can be seen in the way that many inventions are built upon the work of previous inventors. For example, the Wright brothers were able to build upon the work of earlier aviation pioneers to create the first successful airplane.

Invention is also about solving problems. Inventors are often motivated by a desire to solve a particular problem that they have encountered in their own lives. This was the case with Benjamin Franklin, who invented the lightning rod after being struck by lightning himself.

The creative process
When it comes to the creative process, there are a few key things to keep in mind. First and foremost, itâ€™s important to be open-minded and willing to experiment. Secondly, donâ€™t be afraid to take risks â€“ creativity often comes from stepping outside of your comfort zone. And finally, trust your instincts; if something feels right, go with it.
Of course, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to creativity; what works for one person may not work for another. But keeping these general principles in mind can help you tap into your own creativity and come up with new and innovative ideas.
