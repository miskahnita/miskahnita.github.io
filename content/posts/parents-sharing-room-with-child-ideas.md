How to brainstorm effectively.
1. When it comes to brainstorming, there are a few key things to keep in mind in order to make the process as effective as possible. 
2. First and foremost, it’s important to create a relaxed and comfortable environment for everyone involved. This means no judgment, no pressure, and no distractions. 
3. Once you have the right setting, it’s time to start generating ideas. The best way to do this is to encourage free-flowing thought and open-mindedness. 
4. Brainstorming sessions should be all about quantity over quality at first – worry about filtering and refining later on. 
5. It can be helpful to have someone act as a facilitator during the session, keeping things on track and making sure everyone has a chance to share their ideas.
