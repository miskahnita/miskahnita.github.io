How do inventors go about coming up with new inventions?
Invention ideas are one of the most important aspects of any inventor's toolkit. They can be used to solve problems or make new products. However, coming up with new inventions can be difficult. There are many ways to come up with new inventions, but the most important thing is to think of a solution that you can see happening in the future.
One way to come up with new inventions is to focus on a problem that you know people need and want solved.

This will give you an idea for how you could make your product stand out from the competition.
