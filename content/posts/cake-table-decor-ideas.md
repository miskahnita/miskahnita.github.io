Overcoming creative blocks
There are many ways to overcome creative blocks. Some people find that taking a break from their work and doing something completely different helps them to refresh their ideas. Others find that talking to someone else about their project can give them new perspectives.
Some people find it helpful to set strict limits on their work in order to force themselves to be more creative. For example, they may give themselves an hour to come up with an idea for a new painting or only allow themselves to use three colors in their next piece of pottery.

 Whatever method you use, it is important to remember that there is no one right way to overcome creative blocks. What works for one person may not work for another. The most important thing is to keep trying new things until you find what works for you.

Origins of creativity: How has creativity emerged over time, and what reasons do we have for expecting it to continue to grow?
Creativity has been around for a while, and there are several reasons why we think it will continue to grow. One reason is that creativity is oftenasured in terms of what can be done, rather than what is possible. For example, in architecture, the goal is to create something beautiful and unique, not to solve a problem. This focus on beauty means that architects can often come up with really creative ideas that don't solve any problems. Another reason why creativity will continue to grow is because humans are constantly learning. We constantly learn new things and try new things, so our minds are constantly evolving and growing more creative.
