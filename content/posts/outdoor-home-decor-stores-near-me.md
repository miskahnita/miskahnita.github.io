The Importance of Being Creative: Why it's important to be creative when coming up with invention ideas.
Coming up with invention ideas requires a lot of creativity. After all, if you can't think of something new, you'll never be able to invent it.
But why is creativity so important when it comes to invention? For one, it allows you to come up with ideas that are truly original. And when you have an original idea, you're more likely to succeed because no one else has thought of it before.

Plus, being creative means that you're not afraid to take risks. And taking risks is essential when it comes to inventing something new. If you're not willing to take risks, you'll never achieve anything great.

So next time you're feeling stuck, remember that being creative is the key to coming up with invention ideas that are truly innovative and unique.

The Creative Process: How do we go about being creative?
Creativity is a process that we go through every day when we make something new. It can be something as simple as coming up with a new idea for a painting, or as complex as coming up with a new way to market a product. The key is to keep things fun, and to remember that creativity doesn't have to come from the outside- in fact, often the most creative people are the ones who are the most comfortable with their own ideas. So how do you go about becoming creative? Here are some tips: 
1) Take time for yourself- While it may seem like every day is another opportunity to come up with an idea, it's important to take breaks occasionally. If you're always working on projects or thinking about your work, you'll start to feel overwhelmed and stressed. This can lead to negative feedback and decreased creativity.

Creative ideas can be anything from the creative process itself, to how to go about creating something new. Whether you're looking for inspiration for a new quilt or a new painting, there are many ways to find creative solutions. Here are just a few examples: 
- Make your own puzzle book: This is an excellent way to get more out of your creativity and have some fun while doing it. Start by picking out some interesting puzzles to solve, then make your own book folder that holds the puzzles and their solutions. Once you've made one or two, take them around with you and show people what you've done! 

- Experiment with color: Just as with any other aspect of creativity, there's no one right way to do things. What works for one person might not work for another.
