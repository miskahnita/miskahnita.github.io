Idea 4: What are some creative ways to get ideas from others?
Creative ways to get ideas from others have been around for centuries. Some people find inspiration in nature, others through friends, and still others through creativity itself. Sometimes all you need are a few good ideas and some creativity will come naturally. Here are four creative ways to get ideas from others: 
1) Talk to your friends- prospective clients or customers can be great sources of inspiration when it comes to coming up with new ideas. Ask them what they think, what they‚Äôve done that has inspired them, and see what you can borrow from their work. This could lead to new business opportunities or outright invention! 
2) Take on a project- if there‚Äôs something you‚Äôre passionate about, take on a project that speaks to that feeling.

The difference between creativity and art: What are the essential differences?
Creativity, or the ability to think outside the box, is one of the most essential traits for a successful artist. Because creativity is so important, it can be hard to determine which category a person falls into when it comes to art.Some people may see creativity as simply coming up with new ideas or concepts; while others could see creativity as the ability to express oneself in a unique way. It all boils down to what someone considers essential to their artistry.
There are two main categories of creatives- those who come up with ideas and those who create something beautiful. While both types of creatives require some great talent and dedication, there are key differences that set creatives apart from other artists. 

The first difference between creative art and everyday art is that creative art often has a specific purpose or goal in mind.
