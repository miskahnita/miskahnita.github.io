How creativity can help us: Creativity can help us come up with new ideas, solutions, or plans.
Creativity has been said to be one of the most important skills a person can have. It can help us come up with new ideas, solutions, or plans. While creativity is often seen as a positive attribute, not everyone is naturally creative. However, there are ways to improve creativity and become more inventive. Here are eight tips for becoming more creative: 
1. Be open to new ideas. The more open you are to new ideas, the more likely you are to come up with them. If you're resistant to change or don't like trying new things, it will be difficult for you to be creative.

2. Give yourself time and space to think creatively. When you're stuck on a problem or have an idea for something new, give yourself some time away from distractions so that your brain can work freely.

How to overcome creative blocks
If you're feeling stuck creatively, don't despair. There are a number of things you can do to overcome creative blocks and get your ideas flowing again.
One helpful approach is to brainstorm with someone else. This can give you some fresh perspectives on the problem you're trying to solve.

Another tactic is to take a break from whatever you're working on and come back to it later with fresh eyes. Sometimes all it takes is some time away from the project to see it in a new light and have that breakthrough idea.

And if all else fails, there's always the tried-and-true method of just sitting down and forcing yourself to start writing or painting or whatever it is you're struggling with. The hardest part is usually getting started, but once you get going, the ideas will start flowing again.
