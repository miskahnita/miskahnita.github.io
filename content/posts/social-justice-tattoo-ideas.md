Creative tools and techniques: What makes creativity so special?
Creativity is a complex and subjective concept, but there are some general principles that can underlie its definition. One of these principles is the ability to see things in a new way. This skill is often used to come up with new ideas or solutions for problems. Another principle is the ability to take risks. When creativity flourishes, it can lead to new ideas, products, or even services that are better than those that were available before.

The future of work
The future of work is anything but clear. Some experts believe that the internet will eventually disappear and that people will must rely on traditional methods of working, such as jobs in factories or offices. Others think that artificial intelligence and other technologies will soon make it possible for people to work from home, receive health benefits, and even become self-employed. While there are many potential outcomes to what the future of work may hold, it is important to remember that there is no one-size-fits-all answer. What works for one person may not work for another. So how can we create a future where both workers and businesses are satisfied?

The history of brainstorming
Few things in business are as essential as brainstorming. Whether you’re a team of two or a multinational corporation, being able to come up with new ideas is the key to success. But where did this process come from? How did it evolve into the powerhouse it is today?
The origins of brainstorming can be traced back to the early 1900s. American engineer Alex Osborn was looking for a way to increase creativity and productivity in his advertising agency. He came up with a simple but effective solution: get a group of people together in a room and have them bounce ideas off each other. Osborn called this process “brainstorming” and it quickly caught on.

Since then, brainstorming has undergone something of a renaissance.
