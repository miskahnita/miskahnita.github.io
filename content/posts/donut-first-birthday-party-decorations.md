Invention and technology: How has innovation changed over the years?
Invention has always been a major part of human history. From the invention of fire to the development of cars, people have used their ingenuity to make new products and technologies. However, innovation has changed over time, as it has become more and more difficult to come up with new ideas. This is due to a variety of reasons, some of which are global in scope and others specific to each country or industry.
One example of how innovation has changed over time is in the field of telecommunications. With the advent of technology such as radio and television, people were able to communicate with one another far easier than they had ever before. This made it possible for businesses and governments to connect with a wider audience, which in turn led to increased profits and growth. However, while this change was beneficial overall, it also caused some problems.

what brainstorming is, how to do it
Brainstorming is a technique used to generate ideas for a project or problem. To brainstorm, you simply need to allow your mind to wander and come up with as many ideas as possible. There are no wrong answers in brainstorming, so don't worry about being too creative. Just let your thoughts flow and see where they take you.
To get started, find a quiet place where you can relax and focus on the task at hand. Then, set a timer for 10-15 minutes and start writing down whatever comes to mind. Don't worry about editing or critiquing your ideas at this stage; just let them flow freely. Once the timer goes off, you can start looking through your list of ideas and identifying which ones are the most promising.
