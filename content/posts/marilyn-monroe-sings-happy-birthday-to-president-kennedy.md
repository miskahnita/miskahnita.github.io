The challenge of creativity: How do we overcome obstacles and reach our creative destination?
Creativity is an essential part of any person's life. It can be used to create things that no one has thought of before or to come up with new ideas for products or services. However, there are often obstacles that stand in the way of reaching our creative destination. Some of the most common obstacles include lack of experience, creativity being blocked by fear, and a lack of support from those around us. How can we overcome these challenges and reach our creative destination? There are a few ways to start with, but each person's journey will be unique. One approach is to find a group of people who share your same interests and/or goals, and ask them to help you brainstorm ideas. Another way is to read books on creativity or watch videos on the subject. Finally, you can visit art museums and galleries if you're interested in seeing creative works in person.

How to brainstorm effectively.
1. When it comes to brainstorming, there are a few key things to keep in mind in order to make the process as effective as possible. 
2. First and foremost, it’s important to create a relaxed and comfortable environment for everyone involved. This means no judgment, no pressure, and no distractions. 
3. Once you have the right setting, it’s time to start generating ideas. The best way to do this is to encourage free-flowing thought and open-mindedness. 
4. Brainstorming sessions should be all about quantity over quality at first – worry about filtering and refining later on. 
5. It can be helpful to have someone act as a facilitator during the session, keeping things on track and making sure everyone has a chance to share their ideas.
