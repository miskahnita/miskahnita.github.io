Creative processes can vary in their specifics, but all involve the creative process of coming up with ideas, narrowing them down to a few that work well, and then implementing those ideas into a tangible form. Here are three examples of creative processes:

3. Programming: programming is when someone comes up with a solution to a problem or comes up with a new way to do something.
