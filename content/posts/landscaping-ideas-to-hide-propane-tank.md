Brainstorming: How do you gather inspiration for your work?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but there are a few key things to keep in mind when brainstorming what to work on next. First, think about your audience: who are you trying to reach? Are you trying to inspire people to do something or just get some new ideas off your mind? Next, think about the problem you’re trying to solve: is it something that’s currently happening in the world or something that you can see happening in the future? Once you have an idea for a problem, it’s time to start coming up with ways to solve it. Finally, think about how you might approach solving the problem. Do you have any specific examples of how this has worked out before? If not, what kind of inspiration do you need?

Patient engagement and adherence to treatments have come a long way in recent years. However, there are still some ways that hospitals can improve their patient engagement and adherence rates. One way is to make it easier for patients to find information about their treatments. Another way is to provide more comfortable and inviting chairs for patients to sit in. And lastly, hospitals could consider providing more information on the side of the hospital patient room so that patients can better understand what they are taking and how it might impact their health.
