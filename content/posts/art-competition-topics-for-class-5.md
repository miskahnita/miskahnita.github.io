Brainstroming is the process of thinking about a topic excessively and not completing any tasks. This can lead to a lack of productivity and an overall feeling of being overwhelmed. It is important to remember that brainstroming is a mental habit, not a physical one, and should be broken down into smaller tasks that can be completed.
