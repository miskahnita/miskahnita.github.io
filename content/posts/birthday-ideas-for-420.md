2020: How do we make sure that our 2020 election is fair?
In 2020, the United States will face another harsh election season. Key issues that will be debated include how to make sure that the election is fair and what measures can be taken to prevent fraud. Here are four ideas for making sure that the 2020 election is fair: 
1. Create a public database of all registered electors in order to help ensure accuracy and transparency. This would help reduce voter fraud and make it easier for voters to check whether their ballot has been cast correctly. 
2. Increase the number of voting machines from precincts to whole neighborhoods so that more people can vote in one voting place rather than scattered throughout various precincts. This would improve security and ensure that all ballots are counted accurately. 
3. Make it easier for citizens with disabilities to vote by offering identification requirements or waiving residency requirements in certain cases.

Since the beginning of time, there have been various ideas for how to improve society. Some of these ideas have been implemented and are working well, while others have not been successful and have had negative effects. One new idea is to create a government led program that would improve the economy by creating new jobs and making it easier to get credit. This would be a great solution because it would create more wealth and opportunities for people, and it would also reduce the amount of debt people carry.
