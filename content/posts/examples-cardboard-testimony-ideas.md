How can you use brainstroming to your advantage?
The power of brainstroming is clear. By using the right tools, you can use your brain to make decisions that will benefit you and your business. Brainstroming can help you focus on what’s important, gain insights into complex problems, and create better strategies. Here are five tips to help you get started: 
1. Get a clear understanding of what you want from a problem or opportunity. This will help you identify the most important aspects of the problem or opportunity. 

2. Use brainstorms as a tool for brainstorming solutions and for exploring potential solutions to problems. 

3. Choose wisely which ideas to share with others in a brainstorming session – some ideas may be more important than others. Brainstorming is an open-ended process, so it’s best not to limit yourself too much.

The Process of Being Creative
When it comes to creative ideas, the process can be a bit mysterious. Where do they come from? How can you get more of them? While there's no one answer to these questions, there are some things you can do to increase your chances of having a great idea.
First, make sure you're exposing yourself to new things. Ideas often come from seeing something in a new way or combining two disparate things. If you're stuck in the same old routine, it'll be harder to have those "a-ha!" moments.

 Second, give yourself time and space to daydream. Once you have an idea, it's important to let it percolate for a while before taking action on it. Often, the best ideas come when you're not actively trying to think of one.

Finally, don't be afraid to experiment and take risks.
